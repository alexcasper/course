<p>Often, investigation of an incident will involve looking for patterns or similarities with other incidents. Sometimes it might be as simple as providing an existing answer. Technicians and service desk agents are generally technically proficient and knowledgeable, but they should not be expected to know how to fix every single type of issue single-handedly. As such, they make frequent use of a shared information repository called a knowledge base. While some or all of this knowledge base might be accessible to service users, technicians and agents are likely to be more adept at using it</p>
<p><strong><em>Complete the attach knowledge to an incident activity in the simulator.</em></strong> In this task you will be asked to link a relevant knowledge article to the incident record created previously. The incident form's 'Related Search Results' functionality will pull up some suggested similar articles, and agents or technicians can search to find other relevant articles. They can also attach items from the service catalog, suggesting replacement items, for example. Though it is beyond the scope of this course, this suggestion capability can be further optimised using predictive intelligence, a machine-learning-facilitated capability that adapts to past work with incidents. Knowledge articles will be added to the activity stream, allowing those following the incident to see.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;"><em><strong>Complete the add users to an incident watchlist&nbsp;activity.</strong>&nbsp;</em>This task shows how people who are interested in the outcome of an incident resolution process can be added to the watchlist, thereby receiving updates on the process. These might include other technical staff, or those with responsibility for services or communications. While it is beyond the scope of this course, it is also possible for organisations to record and declare a service outage, letting the organisation know that a certain service or set of services is unavailable, but that remediation work (fixing the issue) is taking place.</p>
<p><em><strong>Complete the reassign an incident record activity.&nbsp;</strong></em>Here, we are seeing a process by which an incident can be reassigned from one incident group to another. Staff resolving incidents can draw on the expertise of staff in other teams or departments using the watchlist above. If, however, an incident is shown to be miscategorised, it should be reassigned to the relevant assignment group. Technology services will generally seek to avoid reassignment of incidents, as the new assignment group will have to repeat work in getting to understand the nature of the service failure. They will also have less time to resolve the incident before the service level agreement (SLA) expires. Reassignments, and ways to avoid them, is a key thing that can be investigated when looking to effectively promote continuous improvement in incident management.</p>
<p><strong><em>Complete the create an emergency change from an incident activity in the simulator.</em> &nbsp;</strong>We will cover change requests in greater detail in module 5, however a change request is effectively another type of task, with its own set of states. Change requests are important to register because we do not want to create further service disruptions in the process of fixing an issue. Change requests allow for people in an organisation to keep track of changes being made; depending on the type of change request, there may also be an assessment and approval process. In this case, the emergency change request needs approval to ensure it will not disrupt other services, but the emergency change means it can be approved using a special emergency meeting or process.</p>
<p><strong><em>Complete the create a child incident activity.</em>&nbsp;</strong>Creating a child incident will allow another, similar incident to be recorded. It will pull information from the parent incident about categorisation and assignment group, and receive updates as the parent incident is updated. As with requested items, which have a number of different fulfilment tasks, we can also create assignable incident tasks, representing different tasks taken to resolve the incident, though this is not covered in this task.</p>
