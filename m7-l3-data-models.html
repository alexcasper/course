<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">In the context of databases, data models are described as <em>integrated collections of concepts</em> for describing and manipulating data, relationships between data, and constraints on the data within a business organization.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">They are required because the normal DDL is <em>too low-level</em> to describe the data requirements of a business in a way that would be readily understood by a variety of users.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">The data models therefore provide <em>higher-level descriptions</em> of the respective schemas. They should provide the basic concepts and notations that will permit the database designers and end-users to communicate unambiguously, and accurately, their understanding of the data belonging to their business organisation.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">In other words, the purpose of the data model is to represent data and to make the data understandable. If this is achieved, then it should be <em>easy</em> to design a database. <br><br></p>

<p>The data model can be considered composed of <em>three main components</em>:</p>

<p>In keeping with the ANSI-SPARC three-level architecture, three related data models can be identified:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <em><strong>external data model</strong></em> which represents each user’s view of the business organization:
<ul>
<li>This is sometimes called the <em>Universe of Discourse</em> (<strong>UoD</strong>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <em><strong>conceptual data model</strong></em> which represents the logical view that is DBMS-independent.</li>
<li>An<em> <strong>internal data model</strong></em> which represents the conceptual schema in such a way that can be understood by the DBMS.</li>
</ul>
<p>The data models fall into three widely varying categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Object-based →</strong> describe data at the <em><strong>conceptual and external levels</strong></em>.</li>
<li><strong>Record-based →</strong> describe data at the <em><strong>conceptual and external levels</strong></em>.</li>
<li><strong>Physical →</strong> describe data at the <em><strong>internal level</strong></em>..</li>
</ul>
<p>We will now explore these models further. Please click on the tabs below:</p>
<div class="kl_panels_wrapper kl_panels_expander">
<h3 id="kl_panel_3" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_3">Object-Based Data Models</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_3_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_3">
<p>The object-based data models employ concepts such as <em>entities</em>, <em>attributes</em> and <em>relationships</em>.</p>
<p>This has led to the most common type of object-based data model called the "entity-relationship" (E-R) model.</p>
<p>We will expand on E-R models later in this module.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_4" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_4">Record-Based Data Models</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_4_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_4">
<p>Record-based models consist of a number of fixed-format records.</p>
<p>There are three main types of record-based data models: network, hierarchical and relational.</p>
<p><strong>1. Network Data Model</strong></p>
<p>The network data model is typically represented as a collection of <em>records</em> in which the relationships are represented as <em>sets</em>.</p>
<p>The records become organized as <em>graph structures</em> in which the records are <em>nodes</em> (also known as segments) and the sets are <em>edges</em> in the graphs.</p>
<p>Click on the tab below to see an example of a network data model.</p>

<p><em>The left nodes are branch addresses of a property services agency, and the right set of nodes are a selection of employees working in those branches.</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Hierarchical&nbsp; Data Model</strong></p>
<p>The hierarchical data model can be considered to be a “restricted” type of network data model. The data is also represented as a collection of records, and the relationships are represented as sets.</p>
<p>However, the hierarchical model only permits a node to possess one parent.</p>

<p><strong>3. Relational Data Models</strong></p>
<p>We will look at these in the next lesson.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_7" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_7">Physical-Based Data Models</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_7_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_7">
<p>Physical data models describe how data is stored on the computer, or across multiple computer servers.</p>
<p>The information is represented as a collection of record structures, record orderings and access paths.</p>
<p>The two most common physical data models are the <em>unifying model</em> and the <em>frame memory</em>. For now, think of these as <em>bridges</em> allowing the transfer of data from the storage devices (internal) to the conceptual data model (logical view).</p>
