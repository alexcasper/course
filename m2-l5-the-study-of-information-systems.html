<p><span>The study of information systems</span><span> is a multidisciplinary field that can be divided into technical and behavioural approaches. However, information systems are also sociotechnical systems. Though they are composed of machines, devices and "hard" physical technology, they require substantial social, organisational and intellectual investment to make them work properly.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Figure 2.5: Approaches to Information Systems</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Technical Approach&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The technical approach to information systems emphasises mathematically based models to study information systems as well as the physical technology and formal capabilities of these systems. The disciplines that contribute to the technical approach are computer science, management science and operations research.</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer science is concerned with establishing theories of computability, methods of computation and methods of efficient data storage and access.</li>
<li>Management science emphasises the development of models for decision-making and management practices.</li>
<li>Operations research focuses on mathematical techniques for optimising selected parameters of organisations, such as transportation, inventory control and transaction costs.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Behavioural Approach&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>An important part of the information systems field is concerned with behavioural issues that arise in the development and long-term maintenance of information systems. Issues such as strategic business integration, design, implementation, utilisation and management cannot be explored usefully with the models used in the technical approach. Other behavioural disciplines contribute important concepts and methods.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sociologists study information systems with an eye towards how groups and organisations shape the development of systems and also how systems affect individuals, groups and organisations.</li>
<li>Psychologists study information systems with an interest in how human decision-makers perceive and use formal information.</li>
<li>Economists study information systems with an interest in understanding the production of digital goods, the dynamics of digital markets and how new information systems change the control and cost structures within the firm.</li>
</ul>
<p>The behavioural approach does not ignore technology. Indeed, information systems technology is often the stimulus for a behavioural problem or issue. But the focus of this approach is generally not on technical solutions. Instead, it concentrates on changes in attitudes, management and organisational policy, and behaviour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Socio-technical Approach&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In this approach, optimal organisational performance is achieved by jointly optimising both the social and technical systems used in production. Adopting a socio-technical systems perspective helps to avoid a purely technological approach to information systems. For instance, the fact that information technology is rapidly declining in cost and growing in power does not necessarily or easily translate into productivity enhancement or bottom-line profits. The fact that a firm has recently installed an enterprise-wide financial reporting system does not necessarily mean that it will be used, or used effectively. Likewise, the fact that a firm has recently introduced new business procedures and processes does not necessarily mean employees will be more productive in the absence of investments in new information systems to enable those processes.</p>
