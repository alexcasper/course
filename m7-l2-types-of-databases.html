<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are different types of databases, with the most popular being the <em>relational database</em>.</p>
<p>Why? Because relational databases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide us the ability to understand the way the data is related</li>
<li>Have a dedicated language that can efficiently query and therefore extract the required information, no matter how complex that query is</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore this course will primarily focus on relational databases.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;"><span>Watch this video to learn about relational databases and other forms of databases.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;"><span>The different types of databases, can be categorized into the following “generations”. Please be sure to click on all of the listed generations below to learn more.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="kl_panels_wrapper kl_panels_expander">
<h3 id="kl_panel_0" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_0">First Generation (1960s)</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_0_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_0">
<p>It has been proposed that the use of a database management system (DBMS) came about during the NASA Apollo space missions of the 1960s because there was nothing available to handle the vast amounts of expected information the missions were going to generate.</p>
<p>We therefore saw the emergence of two approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hierarchical:</strong> This involves combining a multitude of small components into many larger components, which themselves are combined into a few larger components, and so on, until one final huge component remains.</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> This enables the representation of more complex relationships than a hierarchical DBMS could model.</li>
</ul>
<p>However first generation databases had a number of disadvantages including the writing of complex programs in order to answer what could be the simplest of queries, and minimal data independence.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_1" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_1">Second Generation (1970s)</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_1_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_1">
<p><strong>Relational database (RDB):</strong> The relational model provided a practical implementation of data structures and operations resulting in:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The conception of <em>structured query language</em> (<strong>SQL</strong>) which is now the standard language for querying RDBs.</li>
<li>The first commercial products appeared in the late 1970s and early 1980s some of which were developed by <em>Oracle</em> and <em>IBM.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The relational model is however limited in its modelling capabilities. This led to the development of the <em>entity-relationship model</em> (E-R) and other more complex database applications.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_2" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_2">Third Generation (1990s)</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_2_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_2">
<p>We saw the development of:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Object-Relational database (ORDB)</li>
<li>Object-Oriented database (OODB)</li>
</ul>
<p>Third generation databases make use of <em>dimensional databases</em> which store data from several data sources, which are maintained from different business units of an organisation.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_3" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_3">Cloud Technologies (2010s)</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_3_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_3">
<p>Current cloud technologies take full advantage of the web-database integration with the likes of Amazon Web Services (e.g. RDS or EC2) and Microsoft Azure (e.g. DataBricks).</p>

<h4 class="kl_modal_title" style="margin-top: 0;">Reveal Answer</h4>
<p>This is debatable.</p>
<p>Some say it is better to store the photos on the file system (hard drive) and store references or paths in the table(s) of a relational database (RDB). This will reduce load and system resources.</p>
<p>Some say that databases can store the photos but use a data type called BLOB (Binary Large Object) such as on the “cloud” with MS Azure.</p>
<p>It all depends on the type of photos being uploaded (e.g. a passport photo uploaded during a user registration process) and security features.</p>
<p>In this situation, an ORDB or OODB would be better suited.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Here are the key advantages and disadvantages of the DBMS. Be sure to click on all of the tabs below to learn more.</span></p>
<div class="kl_panels_wrapper kl_panels_expander">
<h3 id="kl_panel_8" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_8">Advantages</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_8_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_8">
<div class="kl_panels_wrapper kl_panels_expander">
<h3 id="kl_panel_9" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_9"><strong>A1. Control of data redundancy</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_9_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_9">
<ul>
<li>Avoids multiple copies of the same information being stored.</li>
<li>May duplicate some information when appropriate in order to model more efficiently and thus increase performance.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_10" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_10"><strong>A2. Data consistency</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_10_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_10">
<p>As multiple copies are minimized, it is easier and more efficient for the system to be consistent when data items are modified.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_11" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_11"><strong>A3. Increased information from the same amount of data</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_11_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_11">
<p>In comparison to a file-based system in which key information can be easily missed.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_12" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_12"><strong>A4. Sharing of data</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_12_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_12">
<p>The data in a database is available to all registered users within the business, whereas the data in a file-based system will be owned by the end-user or department (e.g. Contracts) and unavailable to other departments within the business.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_13" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_13"><strong>A5. Improved data integrity</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_13_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_13">
<p>Ensures the validity and consistency of the data stored in the database by use of constraints which ensure that no violations take place by adhering to the ‘consistency rules’.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_14" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_14"><strong>A6. Improved security</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_14_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_14">
<p>Prevents unauthorized access to the data. The DBMS enforces any security measures. Registered users will have a username and password in order to gain access to the database.</p>
<p>The users can also be restricted in what information can be accessed, meaning that some registered users who have seniority may have more access to the data than a registered user in a junior position.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_15" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_15"><strong>A7. Enforcement of standards</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_15_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_15">
<p>This assists in the seamless exchange of data between systems following the necessary standards whether they be departmental, organizational, national or international.</p>
<p>These standards ensure the data are in the agreed formats following naming conventions, documentation standards, update procedures and access rules.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_16" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_16"><strong>A8. Economy of scale</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_16_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_16">
<p>Cost savings can very likely be substantial if there is only one database set up for the entire business compared to the costs required to fund every department within the same business to maintain their respective file-based systems.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_17" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_17"><strong>A9. Balance of conflicting requirements</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_17_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_17">
<p>The needs of one user or department may conflict with the needs of another user.</p>
<p>The database administrator (DBA) can ensure that the database provides the best use of the resources for the business as a whole ensuring optimal performance for important applications.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_18" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_18"><strong>A10. Improved data accessibility and responsiveness</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_18_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_18">
<p>The data stored on the database will cross the departmental boundaries, and can thus be accessible to all registered users.</p>
<p>Dedicated languages like SQL can be used to access information from the database.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_19" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_19"><strong>A11. Increased productivity</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_19_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_19">
<p>The user or programmer is more focused on the task at hand and does not need to be concerned with where certain bits of information reside, or have to construct a complicated application to extract the information therefore saving time, cost, and leading to increased productivity.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_20" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_20"><strong>A12. Improved maintenance through data independence</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_20_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_20">
<p>A DBMS separates the data description from the application which results in the application being immune to changes made to the data description.</p>
<p>This is superior to the file-based system in which the description of the data and the logic for accessing the data are ‘hard-coded’ into each application program, and thus making the program dependent on the data.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_21" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_21"><strong>A13. Increased concurrency</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_21_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_21">
<p>If two registered users are updating an item of information with different values, a DBMS will ensure such a conflict does not occur and so data integrity is not lost, as would be the case in a file-based system.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_22" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_22"><strong>A14. Improved backup and recovery services</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_22_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_22">
<p>A modern and efficient DBMS will provide the capability to minimize the amount of processing that is lost should a failure occur by regular backups of the database, along with logs to track the transactions taking place.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_23" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_23">Disadvantages</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_23_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_23">
<div class="kl_panels_wrapper kl_panels_expander">
<h3 id="kl_panel_24" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_24"><strong>D1. Complexity</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_24_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_24">
<p>A very good DBMS will likely be an extremely complex piece of software. All users (DA, DBA, etc.) will need to be aware of this, as in being unaware will likely lead to bad design decisions which could prove costly for the business.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_25" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_25"><strong>D2. Size</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_25_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_25">
<p>Given the complexity and wide breadth of functionality of the database will make it a very large piece of software occupying hundreds of megabytes of disk storage and memory.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_26" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_26"><strong>D3. Cost of the DBMS</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_26_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_26">
<p>This varies significantly depending on the environment and functionality provided.</p>
<ul>
<li>A single-user DBMS for a personal computer may only cost £100.</li>
<li>A large frame multi-user DBMS servicing hundreds of registered users may cost from £100,000 to £1m. There is also the maintenance cost to add on top!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_27" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_27"><strong>D4. Additional hardware costs</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_27_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_27">
<p>On large systems that occupy multiple hard drives (that have been RAID-ed) additional costs will be incurred in replacing hard drives that fail, or to expand the size of the DBMS.</p>
<p>Consequently, it may be necessary to purchase a dedicated high-spec machine to host the DBMS.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_28" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_28"><strong>D5. Cost of conversion</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_28_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_28">
<p>It could be costly to convert the current systems in place within an organization in favour of a DBMS because staff will also need to be trained to efficiently use the DBMS.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_29" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_29"><strong>D6. Performance</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_29_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_29">
<p>An application accessing a DBMS may not be as efficient compared to an application accessing a file-based system to carry out a specific task because the DBMS caters for many applications.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_30" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_30"><strong>D7. High impact of a failure</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_30_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_30">
<p>As all the resources are centralized, this can increase the vulnerability of the DBMS.</p>
<p>If some components of the database fail, this could affect a multitude of registered users, and therefore lead to a halt in operations.</p>
