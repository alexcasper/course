<p style="text-align: left;">DevOps is a philosophy that argues for reducing the distinction between development and operations teams, and the introduction of new tools and methodologies to support more effective service delivery. DevOps is often confused with specific tools, or with a particular role at the intersections of development and operations, but it is actually a set of principles determining a form of organisational behaviour.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">As discussed in the video, Eugene Kim defines three 'ways' or principles that are central to the DevOps movement.</p>

<h3 id="kl_panel_0" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_0">Systems Thinking</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_0_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_0">
<p>Systems Thinking is a discipline that attempts to map systems, including relationships between individuals, organisations and resources. By understanding a system as a whole, we can identify bottlenecks or silos and areas where work is wasted, and progress towards an integrated organisation that shares resources and works collaboratively. System modelling often makes use of feedback loops to demonstrate how metrics are linked and how one activity will affect another.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_1" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_1">Amplifying Feedback Loops</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_1_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_1">
<p>System theory works on the principle of feedback loops, where one variable affects another. There are two forms of feedback loops - reinforcing and balancing loops. With a reinforcing loop, increasing one variable will then increase another, whereas with a balancing loop an increase in one variable will decrease the other. As well as a polarity, there is a strength to each relationship. DevOps would promote identifying the key feedback loops creating value, or promoting positive change, in an organisation and increase the strength of these relationships, so the reinforcing or balancing effect is exaggerated.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_2" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_2">Experimental Cultures</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_2_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_2">
<p>Understanding organisations through system theory, and being able to identify relationships between processes and tools, allows us to explore which parts of the organisation can be refined or upgraded. The goal of DevOps as a philosophy is not just to link up Development and Operations teams, but to promote new forms of collaboration and engagement across the organisation.</p>

<h4><strong>Data Ops</strong></h4>
<p>The DevOps movement, like Agile, has begun to affect the way Data Scientists conduct operations. Previously, Data Scientists would entrust the collection and preparation data to Data Analysts. They would then develop models, before passing on these models to Data Engineers to be operationalised or applied to data at scale. As with Software Development, this lead to delays and problems, as Data Scientists had little control over the data they were getting, and often did not design models with infrastructure considerations in mind. Data Ops recognises the value of Data Lifecycles, but encourages cross-training and collaboration across stages, and automation of infrastructure to provide more rapid and scalable analysis.</p>
