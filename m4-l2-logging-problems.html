<p>Manual analysis can involve exploring the information collected from incidents or outages. While it is possible to use a single incident as a basis for problem detection and analysis, it is also often the case that a single underlying problem will be the cause of a range of issues. A key task for problem analysts is to uncover relationships between incidents that may have been missed during the initial response. In addition to manual detection of incidents, organisations are now increasingly making use of automated solutions for detecting potential problems. Automated problem detection systems will increasingly make use of artificial intelligence to recognise patterns among incidents.</p>

This will allow for a number of things to be copied over from the base incident. Since both incident and problem tables are extended from the task table, they share a lot of common fields. Work done to categorise an incident, for example, does not need to be replicated. We can also easily have access to relevant information about incidents and how they are resolved, allowing us to determine if incidents are being resolved in an efficient and sustainable way.&nbsp;<em>What fields are copied across from the incident record? Which fields are not?</em></p>

Depending on the scale and organisation of the IT department, this might be an entirely separate team to the people resolving incidents. This is why it is important that information about incidents is captured in the system. Problem analysts can also look for other similar incidents, either through searching short descriptions or looking at related configuration items.&nbsp;<em>Given that many incidents can be related to a problem, what is the relationship between the two tables?</em></p>

This is because unlike incidents, which will need to be resolved to prevent breaching service-level agreements, investigating a problem is not always a requirement. In this case, when the problem is automatically moved to the assess stage when it is assigned to a specific person, but a record can also be moved manually using the Assess button. This is effectively saying that the preparatory work has been completed, and it is now possible to decide whether to proceed. <em>Why might an organisation decide not to proceed with the further analysis of a problem?</em></p>
