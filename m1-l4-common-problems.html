<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are several significant, but often overlooked, data issues in many organisations. These issues are usually caused by a combination of insufficiently structured, duplicated and inconsistent occurrences of data.&nbsp; Lacking an enterprise-wide understanding of existing data can cause data to be misinterpreted and misunderstood. If information items, for example, documents, are held more than once, this can lead to confusion and inconsistency.</p>
<p>So, what does an organisation that does not have a proper data management solution in place look like?&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Information systems cannot be connected together</li>
<li>Data cannot be shared across the different systems</li>
<li>Information is often lost due to lack of communication</li>
<li>Data is recorded in a new system</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a look at some examples of how these problems manifest in real life.</p>

<p>You and your colleague have received an Excel file containing the raw sales figures for last quarter's products. Looking at the file, you have realised the data contains only figures covering two months of the product sales. You go back to the person who sent the original file and ask for the third month to be included in the file. You receive the new file, but the sender didn't include your colleague as a recipient in the email.</p>
<p>A week later, you both present your respective figures in different meetings. A manager who attends both meetings points out the discrepancy between the presented figures and questions the data sets reliability.</p>

<h3 id="kl_panel_1" class="kl_border_radius_20 kl_panel_heading kl_panel_1" style="background-color: #e3dfda; color: #000000; border-width: 0px;">Example – Duplication of data - Systems do not talk</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_1_content" class="kl_border_radius_20 kl_solid_border kl_panel_content kl_panel_1" style="border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; background-color: #f5eede; color: #000000; padding-left: 15px;">
<p>The Marketing department in company X has a system to track potential and existing customers. The Finance department has a separate system to support invoicing, payments and accounting functionality. Both information systems have been independently designed and developed to support the respective areas and business processes. An existing customer has recently reported an address change and the details were updated in the finance system. However, as the client's new address is not in the marketing system, new campaigns and offers will no longer reach this customer.</p>
<p>As you can see from the examples above, duplication of data, and the resulting likelihood of inconsistency, is commonplace.</p>

<h3 id="kl_panel_2" class="kl_border_radius_20 kl_panel_heading kl_panel_2" style="background-color: #e3dfda; color: #000000; border-width: 0px;">Example – Incompatible formats – Difficult to aggregate</h3>

<p>While it is no longer technically difficult to share information between systems, this doesn't mean the shared data will be interpreted in the same way.</p>
<p>Suppose company Y is based in the UK and has established a subsidiary in the USA a year ago. The colleagues in the US were asked to record the data (i.e. product ID, date, number, price, and VAT) for each sale in a common database used in the UK since 2000.</p>
<p>At the UK headquarters, a colleague wants to aggregate all sales numbers for the last year by quarter. He realises that some dates have been entered in the format month/day/year (US) while others where entered in the format day/month/year (UK). Also, it is unclear if the price shown for each sale is in GBP or USD.</p>
