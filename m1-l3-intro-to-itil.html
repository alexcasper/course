<p>ITIL stands for the Information Technology Infrastructure Library. This methodology was developed by the UK's Central Computer &amp; Telecommunications Agency in the 1980's, and began as a literal library - a collection of short books published by Her Majesty's Stationary Office.</p>
<p>While at the beginning of the decade computers had been relatively inaccessible and limited to specific departments of large organisations, by the end of the decade they were found in offices of all sizes. As such, there was a greater demand for technology support across both government and industry.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Successive versions of ITIL brought in new developments from the growing technology sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">ITIL version 2, released in 2000, focused on the processes of service management. It drew from the ideas circulating that would also inspire Agile, promoting a more iterative approach. It distinguishes areas associated with service support, and areas associated with service delivery.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">ITIL version 3, released in 2007, introduced the concept of the service lifecycle; ultimately, materials were organised according to which stage they informed. This version developed the focus on continuous improvement, inspired by developments in Lean operations management.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The latest version of ITIL, version 4, was released in 2019 and focuses around the principles, concepts and practices of service management. It widens the focus beyond technology services.</p>

<p>ITIL<span> is not the only information technology service management standard, but it is certainly the most well known. It provides the basis for most technology service management platforms. One such platform is ServiceNow, which you may already be familiar with; ServiceNow was developed as a cloud-based tool to help organisations implement ITIL service management techniques within their organisation. At the same time, other platforms make use of the same methodological basis. The following text, published by rival ITSM tool BMC, provides an introduction to Service Management; while it is not necessary to read the entire text now, it will provide a useful reference for defining the discipline and understanding terms as we work through the course.</span></p>
