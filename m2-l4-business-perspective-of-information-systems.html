<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Managers and business firms <strong>invest in information technology and systems because they provide real economic value </strong>to the business. The decision to build or maintain an information system assumes the return on this investment will be superior to other investments in buildings, machines or other assets. This superior return will be expressed as <strong>increase in productivity</strong>, <strong>increase in revenue</strong> (which will increase the firm's stock market value) or perhaps as <strong>superior long-term strategic positioning of the firm</strong> in certain markets (which will produce superior revenue in the future).</p>
<p>You can see that from a business perspective, an <strong>information system</strong> is an important <strong>instrument for creating value for the firm</strong>. Information systems enable the firm to increase its revenue or decrease its costs by <strong>providing information that helps managers make better decisions</strong> or that <strong>improves the execution of business processes</strong>. For example, the information system for analysing supermarket checkout data can help illustrate how to increase a firm’s profitability by helping managers make better decisions as to which products to stock and promote in retail supermarkets.<br><br></p>

<p>&nbsp;Every business has an information value chain in which raw information is systematically acquired and then transformed through various stages that add value to that information. The value of an information system to a business, as well as the decision to invest in a new information system, is, in large part, determined by the extent to which the system will lead to better management decisions, more efficient business processes and higher firm profitability. Although there are other reasons why systems are built, their primary purpose is to contribute to corporate value.</p>
<p>Figure 2.4 shows the business information value chain. From a business perspective, information systems are part of a series of value-adding activities for acquiring, transforming and distributing information that managers can use to improve decision making, enhance organisational performance and, ultimately, increase firm profitability.</p>
