<i class="fas fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"> </i> Case Study - Changes in the Financial Industry: Adyen and Fintech</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fintech Companies: What’s Next&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>According to experts, the next wave of technology will be even more disruptive. In 2018, Antony Jenkins, who ran Barclays from 2012 to 2015, told the BBC that in the coming years around 50 percent of all jobs in banking (including those of middle managers and customer agents) would be replaced by some kind of artificial intelligence. Andy Haldane, the chief economist of the Bank of England, warned in the same year of a fourth industrial revolution that would cause severe disruption in the job market, and at the heart of it would be artificial intelligence— a modern counterpart to the Spinning Jenny.<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Challenges for Fintech Start-Ups</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This does not mean that success is automatically guaranteed for new companies like Adyen, TransferWise, and N26. A majority of these fintech start-ups go bankrupt, and many of these fintech companies need to make large investments before they can generate profits. Even when they generate profits, these are often, for a time at least, rather small compared to the overall value of the company on the stock exchange. During the first six months of 2018, for instance, Adyen increased its profits by 67 percent to €156.4 million. This may seem like a staggering amount for a company that was only founded in 2006, but it is not a lot of money compared to the total amount of payments it processed (€70 billion). It pales even more if one takes into account the total value of the company on the stock exchange (around €16 billion).</p>
<p>FinTech companies are also being challenged by the major traditional banks who are rapidly developing their own versions of online payment systems, from peer-to-peer payments for retail customers, to highly automated online payment and billing systems for global businesses. As consumers and firms have moved towards mobile and online payments, many traditional banks have invested heavily in new technologies in part using the funds saved by closing down traditional physical bank branches.</p>
<p>Where in-house innovation has not worked, the large banks have purchased fintech firms and folded them into their existing business and technology platforms. Traditional banks have a decided advantage over fintech start-ups: extraordinary cash flow and tens of millions of loyal customers and firms. In this scenario, fintech firms have been early to the party, but typically do not survive to the end of the party, at least not as independent firms.<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Adyen’s Promise&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Like so many other companies in fintech, Adyen is still more of a financial promise than an immediate reality. Investors pay for profits that are still to come, as well as IPO exit strategies that promise rich rewards, even in the absence of profits. CEOs of start-up companies in the fintech sector need to have a keen marketing instinct; they must be able to explain why their idea will make money in the years to come. TransferWise, the company that facilitates money transfers without asking for huge fees for currency conversion, was founded in 2011, but it only made its first profit in 2017.</p>
<p>Adyen's founders were very experienced entrepreneurs when they started their company. They had already created another company, Bibit, which they sold to The Royal Bank of Scotland for €100 million. Indeed, the word ‘<em>adyen’</em> means "again" in a language from Surinam, meaning that Adyen is their second endeavour in the field of financial technology. Many companies never get a second chance, and research shows that around 90 percent of new fintech companies go bankrupt without ever having been profitable.</p>
<p>But those that survive change the banking and payments industry. The first financial results that Adyen released in 2018 show that the company may survive competitive challenges. Year-on-year, Adyen reports, the processed volume of payments has grown by 43.1 percent. TransferWise has also been growing rapidly; in 2018, it reported that 3.9 billion dollars is being sent through its network every month. Both firms illustrate how fintech start-ups are changing the traditional bank and payment systems using new technologies and business models.</p>
