<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This task will help you to apply the module learning to your workplace and can be uploaded to Aptem as part of your portfolio of evidence to satisfy the apprenticeship standard, as such, you are strongly encouraged to complete it.</p>
<p>Sometimes technology and resulting business innovation comes along to change the business landscape radically. Discuss with your line manager and your colleagues, which "disruptive technology" had the biggest impact so far on how your company or organisation is doing business. What do they think the next technological "disruption" will be?</p>
