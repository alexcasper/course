<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">Securing access to a database is very important. The confidential data contained within is a valuable resource and it must be protected at all costs. The access needs to be restricted and controlled tightly.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">Loss of data could prove very costly to a business, especially if it contains personal data of customers. It is therefore vital that mechanisms are in place to protect the database against any intentional or accidental threats.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">The security considerations do not only apply to the data contained within the database but also the network and the storage devices that the database is ‘housed’ in. Breaches of security may therefore affect other parts of the system, which may in turn adversely affect the database.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">Database security involves the need to prevent the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theft and fraud.</li>
<li>Loss of confidentiality (“company secrets”).</li>
<li>Loss of privacy.</li>
<li>Loss of integrity.</li>
<li>Loss of availability.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Most DBMSs provide an approach to restrict access to the database called <em>Discretionary Access Control</em> (DAC). This is supported by SQL through two commands called <strong>GRANT</strong> (to <strong>give</strong> privileges to users) and <strong>REVOKE</strong> (to <strong>remove</strong> privileges from users).</p>
<p>The use of DAC enables the determination of whether a user is permitted to read or write an object based on rules that involve the security level of the object and the permissions/clearance of the user.</p>
<p>This ensures that sensitive data cannot be “passed on” to another user. There is a stronger approach called <em>Mandatory Access Control</em> (MAC) but this is not supported by SQL.</p>
<p>Overall, there is always a <strong>threat</strong> which is defined as any situation or event, whether intentional or unintentional, that will adversely affect a system and consequently a business.</p>

<p>As most databases can be accessed over the Internet, it is vital that the information transferred is protected.</p>
<p>However, internet communication typically relies on the TCP/IP (<em>Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol</em>) as the underlying mode, which along with HTTP (<em>HyperText Transfer Protocol</em>) were not designed with security in mind which means that all internet traffic is “open” and thus vulnerable to interception.</p>
<p>Security over the Internet is therefore vital:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Privacy:&nbsp;</strong>The data must be inaccessible to anyone but the sender and receiver.</li>
<li><strong>Integrity:&nbsp;</strong>The data must not be changed during transmission.</li>
<li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> The receiver can be sure that the data came from the sender.</li>
<li><strong>Non-fabrication:</strong>&nbsp;The sender can be sure the receiver is genuine.</li>
<li><strong>Non-repudiation:&nbsp;</strong>The sender cannot deny that he/she sent the data.<strong></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The obvious concern is protecting the data contained in the database. However, the scope is much wider than that of the DBMS alone.</p>
<p>It also takes into account the database environment as well as the software, hardware and the users.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">Businesses are increasingly needing to account for the actions of their employees and how business activities are carried out in general. There needs to be a sure understanding of what constitutes professional and non-professional behaviour.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">When the business is processing the personal information of their customers or clients, they must have policies in place which clearly describe the data management and IT processes adopted.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">There are two aspects to these policies: Ethics and IT Governance.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="kl_border_radius_20 mps-page-subtitle"><img id="67350" src="https://nulondon.instructure.com/courses/2778/files/802022/preview?verifier=cC6ICjWre1EHCvCBkzm2cb2xEGnrwqrEcfa3N2dx" alt="icon_task_list.png" data-api-endpoint="https://nulondon.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2778/files/802022" data-api-returntype="File"> Ethics</p>
<p><strong>Ethics </strong>can be described as a <em>set of principles of right conduct or a theory or a system of moral values</em>. It can be considered to be “doing what is right” according to the <em>standards of society</em>.</p>
<p>However, the key question that arises here is “whose society?” This is because what could be considered ethical behaviour in one country may not be so in another.</p>
<p>Laws vary in different countries. They can be seen to be the enforcement of particular ethical behaviours, and one can conclude that what is ethical is legal, and what is unethical is illegal.</p>
<p>But is this truly so? For example, is all unethical behaviour illegal? Is all ethical behaviour legal? What do you think?</p>
<p>Ethical codes of practice assist in the determination of whether specific laws should be introduced. Ethics can therefore be seen to be a “gap filler” between new problems that are generated by a technology and when the laws are introduced.</p>
<p>Unethical behaviour in IT can involve installing unlicensed software, accessing personal information from a customer database and divulging trade secrets.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="kl_border_radius_20 mps-page-subtitle"><img id="67350" src="https://nulondon.instructure.com/courses/2778/files/802022/preview?verifier=cC6ICjWre1EHCvCBkzm2cb2xEGnrwqrEcfa3N2dx" alt="icon_task_list.png" data-api-endpoint="https://nulondon.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2778/files/802022" data-api-returntype="File"> IT Governance</p>
<p><strong>IT Governance</strong> is employed for the specification of the <em>decision rights and accountability framework</em> to encourage desirable behaviour in the use of IT.</p>
<p>It incorporates the additional priorities in accountability, decision rights, management and use of IT to ensure business objectives are met.</p>
<p>It needs to also promote the legislative and voluntary regulations, standards and best practice to reduce illegal behaviour, improve efficiencies, and risks of IT failures on other companies, national infrastructure, consumers and the natural environment.</p>
<p>The senior managers such as directors, board members presidents, CEOs (Chief Executive Officers), CIOs (Chief Information Officers), and data administrators are increasingly finding themselves liable for any violations of these laws.</p>
<p>Therefore there becomes a necessity to develop an <em>organization-wide policy</em> for legal and ethical behaviour, and to develop ‘<em>codes of ethics</em>’.</p>

<h4 class="kl_modal_title" style="margin-top: 0;">Reveal Answer</h4>
<p>Some governments have established laws that provide them with unrestricted access to corporate or individual private data.</p>
<p>The USA Patriot Act 2001, established as a direct response to the terrorist attacks of September 11<sup>th</sup> (in 2001), forces US companies with local or foreign servers or companies with data controlled by a US company, to release data on individuals – even if their local laws (for example EU) prevent them from doing so.</p>
<p>Since a US company and its subsidiaries operating in Europe are still subject to the U.S. Patriot Act, European customers that use their services are exposing themselves to U.S. laws.</p>
<p>The US and EU Swiss Safe Harbour framework was established to avoid this situation, however, there have been reports from some US companies operating in Europe that have admitted that this has thus far proved ineffective.</p>
