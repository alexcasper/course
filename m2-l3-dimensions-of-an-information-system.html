<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information systems are computer-based, but they are more than computer programs.</p>
<p>Using information systems effectively requires an understanding of the <strong>organisation</strong>, <strong>management </strong>and <strong>information technology</strong> shaping the systems. An information system creates value for the firm as an organisational and management solution to challenges posed by the environment.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Figure 2.3: Information Systems are More than Computers</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Organisations&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Information systems are an integral part of organisations. For some companies, such as credit reporting firms, there would be no business without an information system. The key elements of an organisation are its <strong>people</strong>, <strong>structure</strong>, <strong>business processes</strong>, <strong>politics </strong>and <strong>culture</strong>.</p>
<p>Organisations have a structure that is composed of different levels and specialities. Their structures reveal a clear-cut division of labour. Authority and responsibility in a business firm are organised as a hierarchy, or a pyramid structure. The upper levels of the hierarchy consist of managerial, professional and technical employees, whereas the lower levels consist of operational personnel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Management&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Management's job is to make sense of the many situations faced by organisations, make decisions and formulate action plans to solve organisational problems. Managers perceive business challenges in the environment, set the organisational strategy for responding to those challenges and allocate the human and financial resources to coordinate the work and achieve success. Throughout, they must exercise responsible leadership. The business information systems reflect the hopes, dreams and realities of real-world managers.</p>
<p>But managers must do more than manage what already exists. They must create new products and services and even re-create the organisation from time to time. A substantial part of management responsibility is creative work driven by new knowledge and information. Information technology can play a powerful role in helping managers design and deliver new products and services and redirecting and redesigning their organisations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Information Technology&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Information technology is one of many tools managers use to cope with change. The information technology infrastructure provides the foundation, or the platform, on which the firm can build its specific information systems. Each organisation must carefully design and manage its information technology (IT) infrastructure to have the set of technology services it needs for the work it wants to accomplish with its information systems.</p>
