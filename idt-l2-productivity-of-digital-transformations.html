<p class="" style="padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px;">The digital economy is already having a seismic impact across the globe, yet the majority of the potential economic impact of digitisation has yet to be captured. The McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) estimated that an additional $13 trillion could be added to global GDP from 2018-2030 through digitisation, automation, and AI resulting from the creation of new business opportunities and the reinvestment of productivity gains into economies.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="" style="padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px;">Whilst the sectors with the highest levels of digitisation also demonstrate the the largest productivity growth, this period of digital transformation has yet to result in major productivity gains across the wider economy. It is an extraordinary fact that for the decade to 2017, the US witnessed its most sluggish productivity growth since the 1970s. Commentators have referred to this as ‘the productivity puzzle’, but one explanation is that the large productivity dividends to be realised from digitisation will not occur until digital technologies are more fully integrated into wider business workflow practices. MGI have estimated this may take to 2045 for full, worldwide diffusion of emerging smart automation and AI technologies in new use cases. A very significant factor influencing the rate of adoption will be the availability of skilled talent able to drive value from emerging technologies and this will be explored in greater depth later in the module.</p>
<p class="" style="padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px;">MGI analysis of the United States, Europe, and China has shown that due to the complexities of business integration, even for well established digital technologies only a small amount of their potential has so far been realised. For traditional incumbent firms, digital channels accounted for just 26% of worldwide sales in 2018, only 31 percent of operations volume was digitally automated, and 25 percent of supply chain interactions digitised.</p>
<p class="" style="padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px;">There is also high variability across sectors, with those focused on services or less physical products typically more advanced in their digitisation. This includes media and finance, with sectors such as pharmaceuticals and certain types of manufacturing lagging behind.</p>

The average across all industries is 24.1%.

Pharmaceuticals/medial products have a digital frontier gap of 13.4%. Signficant drivers are revenue generation, automation and supply chain, and digital workforce.

Business and professional services have a digital frontier gap of 17.0%. Signficant drivers are automation and supply chain, and digital workforce.

Healthcare system have a digital frontier gap of 24.3%. Signficant drivers are revenue generation.

Media has a digital frontier gap of 25.0%. Signficant drivers are digital workforce.

Consumer packaged goods have a digital frontier gap of 28.5%. Signficant drivers are revenue generation.

Financial services have a digital frontier gap of 29.7%. There are no significant drivers.

Automotive and telecom assembly have a digital frontier gap of 31.0%. Signficant drivers are revenue generation and automation and supply chain.

Retail has a digital frontier gap of 46.0%. Signficant drivers are revenue generation.

Travel has a digital frontier gap of  51.0%. Signficant drivers are automation and supply chain.&quot;" width="1200" height="675" data-api-endpoint="https://nulondon.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2778/files/802615" data-api-returntype="File"></p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px; font-size: 12pt;">These averages do not highlight geographic variations, with the US and China the most advanced. A study by Cisco and Gartner has placed Australia in the top 10 countries in the world for "digital readiness," but there is variation across states and as well as the US and China, it also sits behind countries including the UK, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands. CSIRO has identified digitisation as a key global mega trend that Australia must embrace to remain economically competitive. One analysis has found that digital can represent the next frontier for Australian productivity and economic uplift, with the potential to add AU $140 billion to AU $250 billion to Australia’s GDP by 2025, based on currently-available technology alone.&nbsp;</p>

Technology showed the greatest rate of change by the 2000s. Public policy has showed the slowest rate of change, being appromimately 1/3 of Technology.

Curve 1 shows how Technology started at the highest rate of change in the 1970s and started to take off in the 1980s. The curve was much steeper in the 1990s and by the 2000s it was vertical

Curve 2 shows how Individuals started at the next highest rate of change, after Technology. This curve starts to rise in the 1990s and get steeper in the 2010s.

Curve 3 shows how Businessare started at the third highest rate of change, after Technology and Individuals. The curve startes to rise in the 2000's and gets steeper in today's decade

Curve 4 shows how Public Policy started at the lowest rate of change in the 1970s and doesn't start to rise until the 1990s. The curve started to get steeper in today's decade, but it still the lowest out of the four.&quot;" width="1200" height="675" data-api-endpoint="https://nulondon.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2778/files/802603" data-api-returntype="File">&nbsp;</span></p>
