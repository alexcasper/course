<p class="c5239" style="padding-left: 40px;">Digital transformation is being driven by business leaders as both proactive, and defensive responses to the technological drivers of the fourth industrial revolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="c5239 " style="padding-left: 40px;">A survey of global CEOs by Microsoft and Harvard Business Review (HBR) found that four global technology megatrends are acutely important in shaping these strategic priorities:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol class="">
<li class="" data-highlightable="1">Mobile is enabling new business scenarios&nbsp;</li>
<li class="" data-highlightable="1">Cloud computing is driving business agility&nbsp;</li>
<li class="" data-highlightable="1">Big data is helping companies innovate&nbsp;</li>
<li class="" data-highlightable="1">Social channels are transforming core business processes</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="c5239 " style="padding-left: 40px;">As consequences of these rapid technological advances, organisations must respond to new competitive dynamics by:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">

<li class="" data-highlightable="1">Delivering exceptional end-to-end customer experiences&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="c5239" style="padding-left: 40px;">This transformation is therefore impacting every industry, across every aspect of the value chain. This includes businesses selling services, as well as digital and physical products, and innovations are impacting decision making, production, distribution and delivery.</p>

<h3 id="kl_panel_1" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_1" style="background-color: #556c7c; color: #ffffff;"><strong class="">Delivering customer value at every opportunity</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_0_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_0">
<p>Customer centricity has never been more vital than in the digital era. The always-on, connected customer has extremely high expectations of every interaction they have with a business, and the new digital age allows them to easily find alternatives if their current provider cannot meet them. Research from HBR has found that 73% of customers prefer to do business with brands that personalise their shopping experience, and a Salesforce survey has found that 70% of respondents said new technologies have made it easier for them to take their business elsewhere.</p>
<p>These expectations are often formed based on customer interactions in an entirely different vertical, that are then transferred across: if music a music app can deliver personalised music recommendations on demand, why does my bank not know exactly who I am, ready to respond to my queries through an app 24 hours a day? If I can communicate with a retail store through my preferred social media channel, why can I not speak with my energy provider in the same way? This means the pressure for companies to continue to innovate has dramatically increased. Salesforce’s has reported that 57% of consumers said it’s absolutely critical or very important for companies they purchase from to be innovative.</p>

<h3 id="kl_panel_2" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_2" style="background-color: #556c7c; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Employees are critical to this process</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_1_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_1">
<p>Just as customer expectations are crossing boundaries to impact businesses in different verticals, employees are bringing expectations from their own consumer interactions to their enterprises. This includes the growth of enterprise communication tools such as Slack or Microsoft Teams that replicate social media interactions, as well as opportunities to work from any device and any location. Millennials and other 'digitally native' generations now make up the majority of the workforce, and these digitally connected employees can thrive in the dynamics of the new digital economy.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_3" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_3" style="background-color: #556c7c; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Small business innovation</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_2_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_2">
<p>These trends are critical for small business, as well as large enterprises. The intelligent use of smart technologies is allowing organisations to achieve far more with fewer resources. Digital platforms and cloud computing technologies are allowing small businesses to experiment and innovate in ways previously impossible due to cost or lack of capability. This includes market automation technologies that are enabling businesses to personalise interactions with customers across the globe in a cost effective manner.</p>
