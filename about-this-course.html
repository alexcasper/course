<p><span>This course covers the underlying principles and concepts behind relational databases. Learners will use the reporting language SQL to interrogate relational databases and design simple databases. SQL will be used for creating and accessing data tables, indexing, arithmetic operations, loops, arrays, multiple table processing, I/P operations, data-type conversions, and views. Learners will have the opportunity to apply their knowledge of relational databases using industry-standard cloud-based technology e.g. using ServiceNow training.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>COURSE AIMS:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The course aims to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Train learners in the core concepts and techniques for manipulating relational databases.</span></li>
<li><span>Give learners the tools to code native SQL.</span></li>
<li><span>Give learners the opportunity to create various functions in SQL.</span></li>
<li><span>Give learners the opportunity to work on simulated work-based problems and use learned knowledge to solve these problems.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span>LEARNING AND TEACHING PLAN:</span></strong></p>
<p>This is an e-learning course, taught throughout the year.<br><br>This course can be offered as a standalone short course.<br><br>Teaching and learning strategies for this course will include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>On-line learning</li>
<li>On-line discussion groups</li>
<li>On-line assessment</li>
</ul>
<p>Course information and supplementary materials will be available on the College’s Virtual Learning Environment (VLE).<br>Learners are required to attend and participate in all the formal and timetabled sessions for this course. Learners are also expected to manage their self-directed learning and independent study in support of the course.</p>
<p><strong>FEEDBACK:</strong></p>
<p>Learners will receive formal feedback in a variety of ways: written (via email or VLE correspondence) and indirectly through online discussion groups. Learners will also attend a formal meeting with their Academic Mentor (and for apprentices, including their Line Manager). These bi- or tri-partite reviews will monitor and evaluate the learner’s progress.</p>
<p>Feedback is provided on summatively assessed assignments and through generic internal examiners’ reports, both of which are posted on the VLE.</p><script src="https://instructure-uploads-eu.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/account_167640000000000001/attachments/849352/mobile.min.js"></script>
