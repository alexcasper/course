<p>As part of the fulfilment process, requests have one or more request items - representing the different items or services that a user has ordered as part of their request. Often, an item will be associated with one or more catalog tasks, that need to be fulfilled in order to provide the service or item. This idea of having tasks associated with a record is not specific to service requests - incidents, changes and problems can have associated tasks - but here are they are particularly valuable. This is because to prepare an item or a service for an end user, often multiple different people from different departments need to be involved. The fulfilment process is separate to the approval process - in fact, sometimes fulfilment can begin before the item is formally approved.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Service Catalog Tasks are generally created by flows or workflows created alongside or as part of the configuration of service catalog items. Ultimately, they are records in a table that are associated with a particular request item. As they are descendants of the task table, they have similar attributes to other tasks.</p>

As you perform the relevant task, you close the relevant task; this not only keeps a track of whether the item has been ordered, but also allows for the next task, receiving the item, to be generated.</p>

A request management system allows for work to be coordinated across distributed teams spanning a large organisation - we will see this also with incident, problem and change management systems. Note also the stage - this should not be confused with state, which relates to position in a workflow rather than status. Two similar requested items might be in the same state of being 'Work in Progress', but be in different stages of fulfilment. As the item was received, this task would be closed, updating progress while creating the subsequent task.</p>

While catalog tasks generally are automatically created by a flow, they are also extensions of tasks, and so can have more complicated flows and approval steps if necessary.</p>

This cascades upwards, with the request also being marked as closed complete when all requested items being received. Note that this does not work the same way when catalog tasks or requested items are moved to closed incomplete or closed cancelled.&nbsp;<em><strong>After you have finished the above activities, as a stretch activity explore creating some requests and marking some catalog tasks as incomplete, to see what happens.</strong></em></p>
