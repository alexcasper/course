Note that there are different processes based on the change model, or type of change being performed.</p>
<div class="kl_panels_wrapper kl_panels_expander kl_no_expander_controls">
<h3 id="kl_panel_0" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_0">Standard Change</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_0_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_0">
<p>A standard change has the lowest level of complexity and risk, and therefore has the fewest states. A standard change goes immediately from the new record state to scheduled as soon as it is given a date and time. This is because a standard change has been preapproved; these are changes that are very unlikely to disrupt any services, and so do not require evaluation or authorisation. At the same time, it is important that the changes are registered, both to make the changes visible to technicians, and in the event that a rare service disruption does occur. After the allocated time arrives, changes are put into the implement state, and the respective change is implemented. Note that a standard change still needs to respect any periods in which changes should be avoided, and it should still be reviewed to ensure the change has taken place with no consequences. It can then be closed.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_1" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_1">Normal Change</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_1_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_1">
<p>Any change request that is not viewed as routine and inconsequential will go through the full change approval lifecycle. After the record is created, it moves to the assess state, where it is reviewed by another technician or team lead to ensure that the purpose and scope of the change is clear. This state exists to ensure that proper information is collected for change requests, and that time is not wasted in the subsequent state. This state involves a change advisory board, a meeting of delegates from different technology and service teams across the organisation. At these meetings, prospective changes are evaluated; the collected knowledge of people from across the organisation means that the big picture is considered. It also ensures that conflicting changes are not run in parallel, and that where possible changes are distributed throughout the calendar, avoiding business critical periods. This reduces the potential impact of any changes, and makes easier to track what might have caused any particular service issue. After the change is scheduled, it can then be implemented, but it should be reviewed to ensure that it has successfully completed before the change request is moved to the 'Closed' state.</p>

<h3 id="kl_panel_2" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_2">Emergency Change</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_2_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_2">
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>An emergency change is one that is judged to be vital to restore one or more services that are not operational, or to prevent an imminent service outage or security breach. At the same time, with any non-standard change there is a substantial amount of risk involved, and a change needs to be checked to ensure that it will not disrupt any other services or systems across the organisation. An emergency change, therefore, does need to be authorised, but rather than waiting for the change advisory board (CAB) meeting, it is brought to a special group, the emergency change advisory board (ECAB) that has the authority to review and authorise emergency changes.</p>

<p><em><strong>Complete the create a normal change activity on the simulator.</strong>&nbsp; </em>In this exercise, you will fill out the form to create a change request. Note that when you click new on a change request list, or access Change &gt; Create New, you are not immediately taken to the form, but rather to a change model picker that allows you to select which type of change to create. This is because the type of change will have consequences for what tabs and potentially fields are available. Other than that, however, it is similar to an incident or problem form; as with these, you can associate the change with a particular service, service offering and/or configuration item. It can have an impact and priority, though unlike incident the priority here is directly selected. Note that the assignment group should be automatically populated based on the change request chosen - this helps determine who will participate in the assessment process, and who will speak to the change at the authorization stage.</p>
<p><em><strong>Complete the update a change request activity.</strong> </em>This exercise allows you to see how the additional information can be added to the change request; in this case, the planning tab is filled out further, including a justification for the change and an implementation plan. While the rigour and requirements of the process differs across organisations, generally providing more information will reduce the risk of changes being dismissed or misunderstood.</p>
