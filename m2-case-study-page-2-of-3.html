<i class="fas fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"> </i> Case Study - Changes in the Financial Industry: Adyen and Fintech</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fintech Companies: Leveraging Technology for Simpler Banking Advantage&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>When eBay decided to work with Adyen, it gave two reasons for its decision: <strong>Adyen</strong> processes payments more cheaply and gives more control to merchants that use the platform. Adyen is a good example of a company that works in the field of fintech (financial technology). Companies that use technology to facilitate financial transactions have been highly successful over the last ten years. Founded in 2006, Adyen is relatively old for a fintech company, but it has grown enormously - in 2017, as its website proudly boasts, it had €108 billion in processed volume.</p>
<p>Remarkable as Adyen's case is, it is definitely not unique; other firms have used technology to find a new niche in the international payments universe. The company <strong>TransferWise</strong> (founded in Estonia but now mostly operates from the United Kingdom) is another example. It facilitates money transfers between two countries while avoiding currency conversion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How Traditional Banks Differ from Fintech Banking&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Initially, traditional banks find it hard to compete with companies like Adyen. It is in the DNA of fintech companies to develop and focus on state-of-the-art information systems. Traditional banks are very different; they work in buildings, value direct, physical contact with the customer and often have branches in various countries that are more or less independent. Their IT staff often has a supporting role and not, as in the case of Adyen, a guiding one.</p>
<p>Traditional banks use IT systems to facilitate business operations, not to compete with other financial providers. Their IT systems are usually at the national level and may differ from country to country. The heart of Adyen is the financial platform, and IT staff work continuously to make it cheaper and more user-friendly. The data that comes in on this platform is analysed and used to upgrade and update it. The data that Adyen gets is global (the platform processes payments from all over the world) and highly diverse (from payment transactions on the Internet as well as transactions performed in physical shops). This wealth of data ensures that Adyen has better opportunities to analyse the market of payment transactions and its developments than traditional banks do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Creative Destruction – Breaking the Mould&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Fintech is a good example of what economists call "<strong>creative destruction</strong>." This term, originally labelled by the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, describes the influence of technology on the economy. According to his theory, new technologies inevitably result in winners and in losers.</p>
<p>One famous example of a disruption is the invention of the <strong>Spinning Jenny</strong>, a device invented in Britain during the eighteenth century. The Spinning Jenny made the production of cloth more efficient, cheaper, and - critically - reduced the number of labourers needed in the textiles industry. Over the last 30 years, the Internet has had the same effect on society: some jobs have disappeared, and others have come into existence.</p>
<p><strong>A good example is travel agencies</strong>. Forty years ago, there was a travel agency on every high street, but according to the official Dutch statistics agency, 67.2 percent of all holidays in 2017 were booked online. Likewise, traditional hotels now have to compete with sites like Airbnb.</p>
<p>Creative destruction comes in waves, and the banking industry is now in the frontline of change because of the emergence of fintech companies. Adyen has incorporated many stages of the payment chain, and traditional companies that used to provide, for instance, risk assessment now have to either make their business model more efficient or face the very real possibility of going out of business.</p>
<p>The <strong>German firm N26</strong> is another good example of how fintech is changing the banking industry. This company provides payment services just like a normal bank does, but it does not have buildings where <strong>customer agents give advice to the customers;</strong> <strong>everything is online</strong>. In 2018, N26 was attracting 2,000 new customers every day and had secured $160 million from private investors to expand. One of the founders, Maximilian Tayenthal, remarked that traditional banks had not taken N26 seriously when the company was launched.</p>
<p>Companies like Adyen and N26, which make online banking so much easier, have already had a huge impact on the physical presence of banks in many countries. In the United Kingdom, for instance, there were 18,000 branches in 1990; at the end of 2017 there were only 8,000 left. In the Netherlands, the digital banking experience progressed so rapidly that the Dutch government felt it necessary to make it clear that it would not allow the loss of cash payments from the Dutch High Streets as this would severely limit the participation in society of vulnerable groups such as the elderly.</p>
