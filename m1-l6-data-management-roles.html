<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three key roles in Data Management to ensure that data is properly handled and managed.</p>
<p><strong>Data Administration</strong></p>
<p>This is the least technical of the three roles. In the context of Data Management, it is involved with the definition, quality control and accessibility of the organisation's data. The role takes a corporate view of data as the business uses it. It is involved in policymaking as it sets down rules and procedures for data definition, data quality and data usage. It may be involved in developing draft data definitions, carrying out data quality audits and the consequent cleansing of data. This role is often asked to provide advice and expertise on data modelling to system-development projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Database Administration</strong></p>
<p>This role deals with the management and control of the software used to access physical data. Database administrators carry out the day-to-day administration of the various databases and their associated database management systems. Routinely this involves monitoring the performance of the database, removing or archiving data that is out-of-date and maintaining backups in case of emergencies. It may also involve reordering or restructuring a database to improve performance. This role may&nbsp; be asked to provide expertise on physical database design to projects that are developing IT systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Repository Administration</strong></p>
<p>This is the most technical of the three roles. Repository administration deals with the management and control of the software in which 'information about information' is stored, manipulated and defined. It is a role whose scope is the internal support of the data management function.</p>
<h3 class="kl_border_radius_50 mps-page-title"><i class="far fa-file-alt" aria-hidden="true"> </i>Data Management and Information Management</h3>
<p>Previously we have referred to Data Management as the "little cousin" of Information Management. However, it is important to understand that Data Management is necessary to implement well-functioning Information Management Systems and not the other way round.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Figure 1.4: The Relationship Between Data Management and Information Management</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main benefit of Data Management is business-related and is the increased availability of information through data sharing between disparate IT systems. There should also be an improvement in data quality. These will lead to an improvement in the overall efficiency and effectiveness of Information Systems.</p>
