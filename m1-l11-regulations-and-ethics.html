<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">Businesses are increasingly needing to account for the actions of their employees and how business activities are carried out in general. There needs to be a sure understanding of what constitutes professional and non-professional behaviour. When the business is processing the personal information of their customers or clients, they must have policies in place which clearly describe the data management and IT processes adopted.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">There are two aspects to these policies: Ethics and IT Governance.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="kl_border_radius_20 mps-page-subtitle"><img id="67350" src="https://nulondon.instructure.com/courses/2778/files/802022/preview?verifier=cC6ICjWre1EHCvCBkzm2cb2xEGnrwqrEcfa3N2dx" alt="icon_task_list.png" data-api-endpoint="https://nulondon.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2778/files/802022" data-api-returntype="File"> Ethics</p>
<p><strong>Ethics </strong>can be described as a <em>set of principles of right conduct or a theory or a system of moral values</em>. It can be considered to be “doing what is right” according to the <em>standards of society</em>. However, the key question that arises here is “whose society?” This is because what could be considered ethical behaviour in one country may not be so in another. Laws vary in different countries. They can be seen to be the enforcement of particular ethical behaviours, and one can conclude that what is ethical is legal, and what is unethical is illegal. But is this truly so? For example, is all unethical behaviour illegal? Is all ethical behaviour legal? What do you think?</p>
<p>Ethical codes of practice assist in the determination of whether specific laws should be introduced. Ethics can therefore be seen to be a “gap filler” between new problems that are generated by a technology and when the laws are introduced.</p>
<p>Unethical behaviour in IT can involve installing unlicensed software, accessing personal information from a customer database and divulging trade secrets.</p>

<p><strong>IT Governance</strong> is employed for the specification of the <em>decision rights and accountability framework</em> to encourage desirable behaviour in the use of IT. It incorporates the additional priorities in accountability, decision rights, management and use of IT to ensure business objectives are met. It needs to also promote the legislative and voluntary regulations, standards and best practice to reduce illegal behaviour, improve efficiencies, and risks of IT failures on other companies, national infrastructure, consumers and the natural environment.</p>

<p>Some governments have established laws that provide them with unrestricted access to corporate or individual private data. The USA Patriot Act 2001, established as a direct response to the terrorist attacks of September 11<sup>th</sup> (in 2001), forces US companies with local or foreign servers or companies with data controlled by a US company, to release data on individuals – even if their local laws (for example EU) prevent them from doing so. Since a US company and its subsidiaries operating in Europe are still subject to the U.S. Patriot Act, European customers that use their services are exposing themselves to U.S. laws. The US and EU Swiss Safe Harbour framework was established to avoid this situation, however, there have been reports from some US companies operating in Europe that have admitted that this has thus far proved ineffective.</p>
