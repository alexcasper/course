<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you understand what business processes are, it is time to look more closely at how information systems support the business processes of a company. Because there are different interests, specialties and levels in an organisation, there are different kinds of systems. <strong>No single system can provide all the information an organisation needs.</strong></p>
<p>A typical organisation has systems supporting processes for each of the major business functions; sales and marketing, manufacturing and production, finance and accounting and human resources.</p>
<p>Functional systems that operate independently of each other are becoming a thing of the past because they cannot easily share information to support cross-functional business processes. Many have been replaced with large-scale, cross-functional systems that integrate the activities of related business processes and organisational units.</p>
<p>A typical organisation also has different systems supporting the decision-making needs of each of the main management groups. Operational management, middle management and senior management each use systems to support the decisions they must make to run the company. Let's look at these systems and the types of decisions they support.</p>

<p class="kl_border_radius_20 mps-page-subtitle"><img id="71043" src="https://nulondon.instructure.com/courses/2778/files/802490/download?verifier=V0MtCxSN5gHGrIsnCHkWkTmDb5mwLdzGcKp3hhTv" alt="icon_repeat.png" data-api-endpoint="https://nulondon.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2778/files/802490" data-api-returntype="File"> Operational - Transaction Processing Systems</p>
<p>Operational managers need systems that track the elementary activities and transactions of the organisation, such as sales, receipts, cash deposits, payroll, credit decisions and the flow of materials in a factory.</p>
<p class="mps-highlight">Transaction processing systems (TPS) provide this kind of information. A TPS is a computerised system that performs and records the daily routine transactions necessary to conduct business, such as sales order entry, hotel reservations, payroll, employee record keeping and shipping.</p>
<p>At this level, the principal purpose of systems is to answer routine questions and track the flow of transactions through the organisation.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>"How many parts are in inventory?" </em></li>
<li><em>"What happened to Mrs Smith's payment?"</em></li>
</ul>
<p>To answer these kind of questions, information must be easily available, current and accurate. At the operational level, tasks, resources and goals are predefined and highly structured. The decision to grant credit to a customer, for instance, is made by a lower-level supervisor according to predefined criteria. All that must be determined is whether the customer meets the criteria.</p>

<h4 class="kl_modal_title" style="margin-top: 0;">Example – A Payroll TPS</h4>
<p>A payroll system keeps track of money paid to employees. An employee timesheet with their name, social security number and hours worked per week represents a single transaction. Once this transaction is entered into the system, it updates the system's master file that maintains employee information for the organisation. The system's data is combined in different ways to create reports for management and government agencies and send pay checks to employees.</p>
<p>Managers need TPS to monitor internal operations' status and the firm's relations with the external environment. TPS are major producers of information for other systems and business functions.</p>

<p>Transaction processing systems are often so central to a business that failure for a few hours can lead to a firm's demise and perhaps that of other firms linked to it. Imagine what would happen to Amazon if its warehouse tracking system was not working! What would the airlines do without their computerised reservation systems?</p>

<p class="">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="mps-highlight">Business intelligence <span>is a set of techniques, tools and technologies that transform transactional data into useful information which people in the business can understand; it helps managers and other enterprise users make informed decisions. Business intelligence systems for middle management help with monitoring, controlling, decision-making and administrative activities.</span></p>
<p>Business intelligence addresses the decision-making needs of all levels of management. Below are three types of business intelligence systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Management Information Systems (MIS)</li>
<li>Decision-Support Systems (DSS)</li>
<li>Executive Support Systems (ESS)</li>
</ul>

<p>In module 2, we defined management information systems as the study of information systems in business and management. The term <strong>management information systems (MIS)</strong> also defines a category of information systems serving middle management; providing managers with reports on the organisation's current performance. This information is used to monitor and control the business and predict future performance.</p>
<p>MIS summarise and report on the company's basic operations using data supplied by transaction processing systems. The basic transaction data from TPS are compressed and usually presented in reports that are produced on a regular schedule. Today, many of these reports are delivered online.</p>
<p><a id="kl_popup_0_trigger" class="kl_modal_trigger kl_popup_trigger bs-btn bs-btn-primary" href="#kl_popup_0_content">Example – MIS</a></p>
<div id="kl_popup_0_content" class="kl_modal_content kl_popup_content" style="border: 1px solid #A9A9A9; background: #f7f7f7; padding: 10px; max-width: 100%; margin: auto;">
<h4 class="kl_modal_title" style="margin-top: 0;">Example – MIS</h4>
<p>The illustration below shows how an MIS transforms transaction-level data from inventory, production and accounting into MIS files used to provide managers with reports.</p>
<p><img id="71000" class="kl_image_max_fill kl_image_align_center" src="https://nulondon.instructure.com/courses/2778/files/802588/download?verifier=M1aiSsT7DjBDmqgPZdivnHxdR98UaoipFqTfMK0T" alt="3.4_Management Information System.jpg" data-api-endpoint="https://nulondon.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2778/files/802588" data-api-returntype="File"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Figure 3.4: Management Information System</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>MIS typically provide answers to routine questions specified in advance and have a predefined procedure for answering them. For instance, MIS reports might:</p>
<ul>
<li>List the total pounds of lettuce used this quarter by a fast-food chain</li>
<li>Compare total annual sales figures for specific products to planned targets</li>
</ul>
<p>These systems are generally not flexible and have little analytical capability. Most MIS use simple routines, such as summaries and comparisons, as opposed to sophisticated mathematical models or statistical techniques.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_1" class="kl_border_radius_20 kl_panel_heading kl_panel_1" style="background-color: #e3dfda; color: #000000; border-width: 0px;">Decision Support Systems</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_1_content" class="kl_border_radius_20 kl_solid_border kl_panel_content kl_panel_1" style="border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; background-color: #f5eede; color: #000000; padding-left: 15px;">
<p>Decision Support Systems (DSS) focus on problems that are unique and rapidly changing, for which the procedure for arriving at a solution may not be fully predefined in advance. They try to answer questions such as these:</p>
<ul>
<li>What would be the impact on production schedules if we were to double sales in the month of June?</li>
<li>What would happen to our return on investment if a factory schedule were delayed for six months?</li>
</ul>
<p>Although DSS use internal information from TPS and MIS, they often bring in information from external sources, such as current stock prices or product prices of competitors. These systems are employed by "super-user" managers and business analysts who want to use sophisticated analytics and models to analyse data.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <a id="kl_popup_1_trigger" class="kl_modal_trigger kl_popup_trigger bs-btn bs-btn-primary" href="#kl_popup_1_content">Example – A Voyage-Estimating System</a> &nbsp;</p>
<div id="kl_popup_1_content" class="kl_modal_content kl_popup_content" style="border: 1px solid #A9A9A9; background: #f7f7f7; padding: 10px; max-width: 100%; margin: auto;">
<h4 class="kl_modal_title" style="margin-top: 0;">Example – A Voyage-Estimating System</h4>
<p>An interesting, small, but powerful DSS is the voyage-estimating system of a large global shipping company that transports bulk cargoes of coal, oil ores and finished products. The firm owns some vessels, charters others and bids for shipping contracts in the open market to carry general cargo.</p>
<p>A voyage-estimating system calculates financial and technical voyage details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial calculations include ship/time costs (fuel, labour, capital), freight rates for various cargo types and port expenses.</li>
<li>Technical details include multiple factors, such as ship cargo capacity, speed, port distances, fuel and water consumption and loading patterns (location of cargo for different ports).</li>
</ul>
<p>The system can answer questions such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a customer delivery schedule and an offered freight rate, which vessel should be assigned at what rate to maximise profits?</li>
<li>What is the optimal speed at which a particular vessel can optimise its profit and still meet its delivery schedule?</li>
<li>What is the optimal loading pattern for a ship bound for Rotterdam from Malaysia?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The DSS in the above example draws heavily on models. Other business intelligence systems are more data-driven, focusing instead on extracting useful information from very large data quantities. For example, ski resort companies such as Intrawest and Vail Resorts collect and store large amounts of customer data from call centres, lodging and dining reservations, ski schools and ski equipment rental stores. They use software to analyse the data to determine the value, revenue potential and loyalty of each customer to help managers make better decisions about how to target their marketing programmes.</p>

<div id="kl_panel_2_content" class="kl_border_radius_20 kl_solid_border kl_panel_content kl_panel_2" style="border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; background-color: #f5eede; color: #000000; padding-left: 15px;">
<p>Executive Support Systems (ESS) address the decision-making needs of senior management; focusing on strategic issues and long-term trends, both in the organisation and the external environment. They are concerned with questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What will employment levels be in five years?</li>
<li>What are the long-term industry cost trends?</li>
<li>What products should we be making in five years?</li>
</ul>
<p>ESS help senior management address non-routine decisions requiring judgment, evaluation and insight because there is no agreed-on procedure for arriving at a solution.</p>
<p>ESS present graphs and data from many sources through an easy interface; information is often delivered to senior executives through a portal, which uses a web interface to present integrated personalised business content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ESS are designed to incorporate data about external events, such as new tax laws or competitors, but also draw summarised information from internal MIS and DSS. They filter, compress and track critical data, displaying the data of greatest importance to senior managers. Increasingly, such systems include business intelligence analytics for analysing trends, forecasting and "drilling down" to more detailed data.</p>

<h4 class="kl_modal_title" style="margin-top: 0;">Example – Valero's Refining Dashboard</h4>
<p>The chief operating officer (COO) and plant managers at Valero, the world's largest independent petroleum refinery, use a Refining Dashboard to display real-time data related to plant and equipment reliability, inventory management, safety and energy consumption.</p>
<p>Using the dashboard, the COO and their team can review the performance of each Valero refinery in the United States and Canada in terms of how each plant is performing compared to the production plan of the firm.</p>
<p>The headquarters team can drill down from the executive level to the refinery level and even see individual system-operator level of performance.</p>
</div>
<p>Digital dashboards are a common tool for management decision-makers; displaying, on a single screen, graphs and charts of key performance indicators for managing a company.</p>
