<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identify a problem in your workplace that would be best solved by a simple database (e.g. 5 to 6 tables).</p>
<p>If you can’t identify a problem, think about a future task, such as organising a team-building, social event or conference.</p>
<p>In this case, details such as colleagues’ names, employee IDs, departments, personal mobile numbers, transport, accommodation and catering preferences might need to be collated.</p>
<p>For this week’s activity, you must <em>design</em> the database but not implement it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
