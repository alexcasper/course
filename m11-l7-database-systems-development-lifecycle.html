<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">Software applications developed over the last few decades have generally required constant maintenance such as correcting programming faults (i.e. “bugs”), implementing new user requirements, or to modify the software in its entirety in order for it to run successfully on new or upgraded platforms or hardware.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">The effort that has been spent on such maintenance can be costly in both time and finances, in addition to the absorption of other resources.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">This had a severe impact on many major software projects making them late to deliver, over budget, unreliable, increased difficulty in maintenance and inefficient performance of the final product.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">As far back as the late 1960s, worries of a “software depression” ensued.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">Three key major reasons as to why these software projects failed were attributed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of information in relation to specific requirements.</li>
<li>Lack of information in relation to the appropriate development methodology.</li>
<li>The inability to split the design into manageable components.</li>
</ul>
<p>This therefore led to the decision to implement a more structured approach to developing software applications known as the <em>Information Systems Lifecycle</em> (ISLC).</p>
<p>In a similar manner, we now have the <em>Database Systems Development Lifecycle</em> (DSDLC) which involves the following:</p>
<div class="kl_panels_wrapper kl_panels_accordion">
<h3 id="kl_panel_0" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_0">Database Planning</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_0_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_0">
<p>These are management activities which allow stages of the DSDLC to be efficiently and effectively realized.</p>
<p>The planning must also be integrated with the overall Information System strategy of the business.</p>
<p>The database planning should also include the development of agreed standards that will dictate how:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data is to be collected and processed.</li>
<li>What the format of the data will be and how to specify it.</li>
<li>What essential documentation will be required.</li>
<li>How the design and implementation of the database will be achieved.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_1" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_1">System Definition</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_1_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_1">
<p>This involves the agreeing of the scope and boundaries of the database system and the major user views, which define what will be required of a database system from the perspective of a member of staff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The user views must be identified early to avoid any major issues, such as not accounting for senior members of staff.</p>
<p>The user views can also assist in the development of complex database systems in which the requirements can be split into smaller manageable sections.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_2" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_2">Requirements Collection and Analysis</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_2_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_2">
<p>This is a very important part of the cycle because it involves the collection, processing and analysis of the information pertaining to the area of the business that will be supported by the database system.</p>
<p>Information concerning how the database is to be used (and by who) can be gathered by a specially constructed questionnaire.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_3" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_3">Database Design</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_3_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_3">
<p>This is the process of creating a design for a database system that will support the mission statement and mission objectives of the business.</p>
<p>For the construction of a successful data model, we need to understand what entities, relations and attributes will be required.</p>
<p>The three distinctive phases required for the design of a database are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conceptual database design</li>
<li>Logical database design</li>
<li>Physical database design</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_4" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_4">DBMS Selection</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_4_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_4">
<p>This is required to support the database system.</p>
<p>However, if one is already “available” then this step can be skipped.</p>
<p>It can be performed at any stage prior to the logical design as long as the appropriate information has been supplied in terms of the system requirements. The key steps involved in choosing a DBMS are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To define the <em>Terms of Reference</em> of study.</li>
<li>Shortlist two or three (available) products.</li>
<li>Evaluation of the products.</li>
<li>Recommendation of the selection of the product accompanied by a detailed report.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_5" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_5">Application Design</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_5_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_5">
<p>This involves the design of the user interface and the application programs that will employ and process the database.</p>
<p>This goes hand-in-hand with the database design.</p>
<p>There are two important activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transaction design
<ul>
<li>Actions or series of actions that will be carried out by a single user or application program which will access or change the content of the database.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>User interface design
<ul>
<li>Deciding on the layout of the interface including a meaningful title, visually appealing layout, along with clear and concise field labels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_6" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_6">Prototyping</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_6_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_6">
<p>This is a working model of a database system. It can assist in identifying the features of a system that work very well, or that under perform.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_7" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_7">Implementation</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_7_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_7">
<p>This is the actual <em>physical realization</em> of the database and application program designs.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_8" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_8">Data Conversion and Loading</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_8_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_8">
<p>This involves the transference of any existing data into a new database and applying any appropriate conversions to the data format or type.</p>
<p>It also involves converting any existing applications to be able to run on the new database.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_9" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_9">Testing</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_9_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_9">
<p>The purpose of <strong><em>testing</em></strong> is to run the database system so that any errors can be discovered.</p>
<p>This involves carefully planned procedures and realistic data.</p>
<p>The testing will not be able to highlight the absence of faults, but it will be able to show that software faults are present.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_10" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_10">Operational Maintenance</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_10_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_10">
<p>This is the process of monitoring and maintaining the database system after it has been completely installed.</p>
<p>During the performance monitoring, if it is found to fall then retuning and reogranisation of the database may be initiated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will also be the requirement to maintain and upgrade the database application and to also incorporate any new requirements into the database application.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>We can see how these link together in the figure below.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The flow diagram demonstrating the Database System Development Lifecycle (DSDLC).</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The starting point is the “<strong>Database planning</strong>” which leads into the “<strong>System definition</strong>” and then the “<strong>Requirements Collection and Analysis</strong>” (user preferences and requirements input).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The corresponding output can either move to the <strong>design</strong> <strong>of the database</strong> and/or the <strong>design of the software application</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">From either output, there is the option to <strong>develop a prototype</strong> whose output can feed into additional requirements, or to <strong>implement </strong>the build of the database and/or software application.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The efficiencies of <strong>data conversion and loading</strong>, and then formal <strong>testing </strong>can feed into the “<strong>operational maintenance</strong>”, the output of this <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>feeding back</strong></em></span> into the <strong>database planning </strong>should updates/upgrades be required.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">From this, the <em><strong>cycle repeats itself</strong></em>.</p>

<p>In the Database Systems Development Lifecycle, where we are concerned with the database design (conceptual, logical and physical), we have additional yet very important steps to include/consider (click on the tabs):</p>
<div class="kl_panels_wrapper kl_panels_accordion">
<h3 id="kl_panel_11" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_11">1. Designing file organisations and indexes</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_11_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_11">
<p>This involves understanding the typical workload that the database must support.</p>
<ul>
<li>Analysing transactions by assessing the performance criteria of the transactions that will run on the database, leading to identification of parts of the database that may cause performance problems.</li>
<li>Choosing the efficient type of file organization for each base relation, and documenting the choice.</li>
<li>Choosing the index.</li>
<li>Estimation of the disk space requirements for the database.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_12" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_12">2. Designing the user views</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_12_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_12">
<p>This may be based on information that was collected from a questionnaire or some other form of ‘<em>Requirements Collection and Analysis</em>’.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, different staff levels/grades may require different views. Documentation is vital.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_13" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_13">3. Designing the security mechanisms</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_13_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_13">
<p>This is specified by the users. Documentation is vital.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_14" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_14">4. Controlling data redundancy.</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_14_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_14">
<p>This is to see if system performance can be improved.</p>
<p>Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Combining one-to-one relationships.</li>
<li>Introducing repeating groups.</li>
<li>Creating extract tables.</li>
<li>Partitioning relations.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_15" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_15">5. Monitoring and tuning the operational system</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_15_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_15">
<p>The objective is to improve performance of the system by correcting for an inappropriate design decisions, or to reflect any changing requirements.</p>
<p>It is especially import to understand how the various hardware components interact with and affect the performance of the database.</p>
