<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Case study extracted from: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-government-data-quality-framework/the-government-data-quality-framework-case-studies">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-government-data-quality-framework/the-government-data-quality-framework-case-studies</a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Year of quality </strong></span></p>
<p>This case study has been developed to highlight the important steps required within a policing organisation to develop a culture of high data quality. Evidence suggests that high data quality is of primary importance to policing, and that a data quality culture does not exist consistently and effectively across the service.</p>
<p>All organisations have culture, i.e. a set of norms and values which collectively guide the behaviour of their employees. Culture is neither good nor bad, but it can nurture values and behaviours which either support or prevent organisational development. Cultures which inhibit high data quality can be a significant barrier to creating and leveraging knowledge assets and realising the value of our technological investments. The principal aim is to support forces in developing an ethos amongst all employees that poor data standards are unacceptable and to commit the force to a programme of continuous improvement.</p>

<div id="kl_panel_0_content" class="kl_border_radius_20 kl_solid_border kl_panel_content kl_panel_0" style="border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; background-color: #f5eede; color: #000000;">
<p>This does not only mean the most senior person in the organisation. Of course, you want your Chief Constable or Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) to set the strategic direction, but it is the network of informal leaders that will embed the concept of high data quality across all ranks and roles within the organisation. They command the respect of their peers.</p>
<p>Identifying and engaging with these people at the outset of any planned programme of action will ensure that:</p>
<div class="mps-highlight">
<ul>
<li>You understand the data and information needs of your organisation at an organic level.</li>
<li>Your message will be communicated in a way that resonates with the audience</li>
<li>This is not a one-off exercise but becomes business as usual.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_1" class="kl_border_radius_20 kl_panel_heading kl_panel_1" style="background-color: #e3dfda; color: #000000; border-width: 0px;"><strong>2. Organisational Commitment </strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_1_content" class="kl_border_radius_20 kl_solid_border kl_panel_content kl_panel_1" style="border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; background-color: #f5eede; color: #000000; padding-left: 15px;">
<ul>
<li>It is not enough to tell people what is expected, the organisation must make a real and tangible commitment to supporting high data quality:</li>
<li>A corporate framework for the management of, and accountability for, data quality is in place with a commitment to secure a culture of high data quality throughout the service and with partners. This accountability is at both an organisational and individual level.</li>
<li>Policies and procedures are in place to ensure the quality of the data recorded and used. The organisation must ensure that policies and procedures are up to date and reflective of how the organisation works.</li>
<li>Systems and processes are in place, which ensure the quality of data as part of the normal business of the force – focussing on the data that matters.</li>
<li>Arrangements are in place to ensure that staff have the appropriate knowledge, competencies and capacity in their roles in relation to data quality and that this is embedded in all training and learning material.</li>
<li>Arrangements are in place that are focussed on ensuring that data is actively used in decision making, resource allocation and planning processes and is subject to internal control and validation. ‘Sell’ your data – restore trust in what the data shows.</li>
<li>Create a culture where a commitment to data quality is considered part of what makes a good police officer.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="kl_panel_2" class="kl_border_radius_20 kl_panel_heading kl_panel_2" style="background-color: #e3dfda; color: #000000; border-width: 0px;"><strong>3. Baseline your maturity</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_2_content" class="kl_border_radius_20 kl_solid_border kl_panel_content kl_panel_2" style="border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; background-color: #f5eede; color: #000000; padding-left: 15px;">
<p>To target efforts effectively it is important to baseline your force’s maturity in its relationship with data.</p>
<p>A maturity model is simply a framework that is used as a benchmark for comparison when looking at an organisation’s processes. In this instance it is specifically used when evaluating the capability to implement data management strategies and the level at which the force could be at risk.</p>
<p>The Information Assets Maturity Model is designed to provide the police service with a comprehensive reference tool for driving improvements in data. This tool will allow organisations to assess themselves against recognised best practice and develop detailed data management improvement plans which support the maximisation of the benefits data presents.</p>
<p>There are four pillars under which a force should be assessed:</p>
<div class="mps-highlight">
<ol>
<li>Process – the ability of an organisation to understand its capabilities to use data to drive business processes and innovation.</li>
<li>People – the ability of an organisation to recognise the skills and capabilities needed to create and use good quality data.</li>
<li>Technology – the ability of an organisation to understand the technical solutions needed to support the optimisation of data.</li>
<li>Data – the ability of an organisation to understand the data and information it creates and uses.</li>
</ol>
<p>This must encompass the entire organisation – a force will not have a holistic view of its maturity if all areas of the business are not represented.</p>

<h3 id="kl_panel_3" class="kl_border_radius_20 kl_panel_heading kl_panel_3" style="background-color: #e3dfda; color: #000000; border-width: 0px;"><strong>4. Make data quality matter on a personal level- articulate why</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_3_content" class="kl_border_radius_20 kl_solid_border kl_panel_content kl_panel_3" style="border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; background-color: #f5eede; color: #000000; padding-left: 15px;">
<p>Communicating the ‘why’ is critical to the success of any data quality improvement programme. An organisation should consider the best way to deliver these messages – considering a range of non-standard communication tools.</p>
<p><strong>Road shows: </strong>Staff from the Data Quality Team (or an equivalent) will carry out a series of road shows across the force to introduce the main messages around data quality.</p>
<p><strong>Intranet:&nbsp;</strong>The main messages of the campaign and a guidance document will be made available via the force intranet on a regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop wallpaper:&nbsp;</strong>A desktop wallpaper will be produced and updated on a regular basis to reflect key messages of the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>PowerPoint briefing:&nbsp;</strong>A PowerPoint briefing document will be produced by the Data Quality Team which will be circulated to all Sergeants and other supervisors to deliver as part of the staff briefing process.</p>
<p><strong>Induction pack:&nbsp;</strong>The force will produce a comprehensive pack of information and guidance for all new members of staff – detailing their responsibilities upon joining the force.</p>
<p><strong>Integrated training:&nbsp;</strong>The Data Quality Team will provide core training material to the learning and development lead to ensure that the main messages are woven into all training programmes. Messages will be tailored to suit specific business functions.</p>
<p><strong>Data quality electronic newsletter:&nbsp;</strong>A data quality quarterly newspaper will be produced by the Data Quality Team. The newsletter will be available electronically and will include topical information in relation to data quality. Case study information will be included to help the reader focus on the main messages of the campaign – case studies will be operational in focus.</p>
<p><strong>Data quality information sheet (aide-mémoire):&nbsp;</strong>A data quality information sheet which will act as a briefing sheet for staff will be produced and disseminated via the force intranet. This briefing sheet will be tailored to specific business functions.</p>
<p><strong>Posters:&nbsp;</strong>A series of impactful, operationally focussed posters to highlight the ‘why’ of this campaign. Examples:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<div class="mps-highlight">
<ul>
<li>‘What happens to the data you create?’</li>
<li>‘Data sharing with partners’</li>
<li>‘What’s in a name?’</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Data quality commanders packs:&nbsp;</strong>Quarterly report to go to all commanders or information asset owners (IAO) to highlight the quality of data of the data assets their staff are responsible for. A summary of packs will be presented to the Information Management Board (or equivalent) for action and escalation as required.<a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27752/data-dictionary"></a></p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_4" class="kl_border_radius_20 kl_panel_heading kl_panel_4" style="background-color: #e3dfda; color: #000000; border-width: 0px;"><strong>5. Take positive action- task force</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_4_content" class="kl_border_radius_20 kl_solid_border kl_panel_content kl_panel_4" style="border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; background-color: #f5eede; color: #000000; padding-left: 15px;">
<p>To make best of use of what is likely to be a small internal resource the force should be targeting their efforts on the data that matters most to them. This will likely be similar in each force, but there will be nuances that need to be considered.</p>
<p>This stage links in with existing workstreams, for example General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) implementation and the roll out of information asset registers and IAOs. Forces should already know their data assets – however there are some important questions:</p>
<div class="mps-highlight">
<ol>
<li>What is the quality of your data?
<ol>
<li>What assessment criteria should you use?</li>
<li>How will this assessment be recorded?</li>
<li>How is this data used?</li>
<li>Is it live or legacy data?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>What impact does this have on your force?
<ol>
<li>What ‘hidden’ corrective actions already take place?</li>
<li>What are the estimated costs of these actions?</li>
<li>What do the customers of the data feel?</li>
<li>How is the impact recorded and understood?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>What are the potential solutions to managing this data? Cleansing data may not be the only option.
<ol>
<li>Forces could consider the following to allow risk-based decisions to be made about the retention of the data:
<ol>
<li>What was the purpose of the data and is the purpose still current?</li>
<li>When was the data live and are any elements within it still being updated?</li>
<li>Is the data searchable?</li>
<li>Does data need to be retained in relation to any ongoing public inquiry?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If cleansing is the preferred option – any improvement plan needs to be based on the needs of the organisation:
<ol>
<li>Identify and eliminate the root causes of error.</li>
<li>Build a continuous improvement programme to minimise errors going forward.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Whatever action is completed, it must focus on the needs of the users. In conclusion, developing a culture of high data quality requires an organisation-wide programme of action – with clear leadership, clarification of the needs of the organisation, clarification of the expectations of the organisation and a realisation of the benefits good data can bring.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<p>Based on your review of the case study, think about and answer the following questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>What kind of data management activities can you identify in this case?</li>
<li>Why is data quality important for a policing organisation’s ability to use data and gain useful insights? What is the impact of poor data quality on the organisation’s ability to remain effective and serve its purpose?</li>
<li>Based on this case study, does it seem that ensuring data quality is costly affair? What would the organisations lose if they used poor quality data compared to the benefits they would gain?</li>
</ol>
