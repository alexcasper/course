<p><br>Ethics refers to the principles of right and wrong that individuals, acting as free moral agents, use to make choices to guide their behaviour. Information systems raise new ethical questions for both individuals and societies because they create opportunities for intense social change and threaten existing distributions of power, money, rights and obligations. Information technology can be used to achieve social progress, but it can also be used to commit crimes and threaten social values. The development of information technology will produce benefits for many and costs for others.</p>

<p>Ethical issues in information systems have been given new urgency by the rise of the Internet and e-commerce. Internet and digital technologies make it easier than ever to assemble, integrate and distribute information, unleashing concerns about the appropriate use of customer information, the protection of personal privacy and the protection of intellectual property.</p>
<p>Other ethical issues that information systems raise include establishing accountability for the consequences of information systems, setting standards to safeguard system quality that protects the safety of the individual and society and preserving values and institutions considered essential to the quality of life in an information society.</p>
<p><strong>When using information systems, it is essential to ask, "What is the ethically and socially responsible course of action?"</strong></p>
<p>In general, the integrity of information relies upon the development and operation of computer-based information systems. Those who undertake the planning, development and operation of these information systems have obligations to assure information integrity and overall to contribute to the public good. Their ethical practice is paramount and concerns two distinct areas; <strong>process</strong> and <strong>product</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Failures in Ethical Judgement</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past 20 years, you could witness one of the most ethically challenging periods for national and international business. Here are two examples.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a id="kl_popup_0_trigger" class="kl_modal_trigger kl_popup_trigger bs-btn bs-btn-primary" href="#kl_popup_0_content">Example – Volkswagen Emissions Scandal</a></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="kl_popup_0_content" class="kl_modal_content kl_popup_content" style="border: 1px solid #A9A9A9; background: #f7f7f7; padding: 10px; width: 600px; max-width: 100%; margin: auto;">
<h4 class="kl_modal_title" style="margin-top: 0;">Example – Volkswagen Emissions Scandal</h4>
<p>In September 2015, the US Environmental Protection Agency found that between 2008 and 2015, many Volkswagen cars were sold with a "defeat device" – or software – in diesel engines that could detect when they were being tested, changing the performance accordingly to improve results.</p>
<p>Later that year, VW admitted cheating the emissions test in the US and were fined with criminal penalties. As of mid 2020, the scandal had cost VW $33.3 billion in finance, penalties, financial settlements and buyback costs.</p>
<p>At the centre of the scandal is misinformation generated by onboard software; an information system. <span>This information system was developed and implemented by professionals who must have been party to this illegal and unethical act.</span></p>
</div>
<p><strong><a id="kl_popup_1_trigger" class="kl_modal_trigger kl_popup_trigger bs-btn bs-btn-primary" href="#kl_popup_1_content">Example – UK Child Support Agency</a>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<div id="kl_popup_1_content" class="kl_modal_content kl_popup_content" style="border: 1px solid #A9A9A9; background: #f7f7f7; padding: 10px; width: 600px; max-width: 100%; margin: auto;">
<h4 class="kl_modal_title" style="margin-top: 0;">Example – UK Child Support Agency</h4>
<p>The UK Child Support Agency's system overpaid 1.9 million people and underpaid around 700,000 in 2004. Inadequate systems analysis resulted in the introduction of a large and complex information system at the same time as restructuring the agency, leading to enormous operational difficulties. In terms of IS practice, it appears this was a process failing, which could be deemed to be unethical.</p>

<p>Ethical issues preceded information technology, however information technology has heightened ethical concerns, taxed existing social arrangements and made some laws obsolete or severely crippled.</p>
<p>The following key technological trends contribute to these ethical stresses:</p>
<p><strong>Computer Power</strong><strong> Doubling Every 18 months&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The doubling of computing power every 18 months has made it possible for most organisations to use information systems for their core production processes. As a result, our dependence on systems and our vulnerability to system errors and poor data quality have increased. Social rules and laws have not yet adjusted to this dependence. Standards for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of information systems are not universally accepted or enforced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Data Storage</strong><strong> Costs Rapidly Decline&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Advances in data storage techniques and rapidly declining storage costs have contributed to the proliferation of databases on individuals—employees, customers and potential customers—maintained by private and public organisations. These advances in data storage have made the routine violation of individual privacy, both inexpensive and effective. Enormous data storage systems for terabytes and petabytes of data are now available on-site or as online services for firms of all sizes to use in identifying customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Data Analysis</strong><strong> Advances&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Advances in data analysis techniques for large pools of data are another technological trend that heightens ethical concerns. Companies and government agencies can find out highly detailed personal information about individuals. With data management tools, companies can assemble and combine numerous pieces of information about you stored on computers much more easily than in the past.</p>
<p>Think of all the ways you generate digital information about yourself; credit card purchases, telephone calls, magazine subscriptions, online purchases, banking records, local and government records (including court and police records) and visits to websites. Put together and mined properly, this information could reveal not only your credit information but also your driving habits, your tastes, your associations, what you read and watch and your political interests.</p>
<p>Companies purchase relevant personal information from these sources to help them more finely target their marketing campaigns. Companies can analyse large pools of data from multiple sources to identify customers' buying patterns and make individualised recommendations rapidly. The use of technology to combine data from multiple sources and create digital dossiers of detailed information on individuals is called profiling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Networking</strong></p>
<p>Advanced networking, including the internet, promises to reduce greatly the costs of moving and accessing large quantities of data and open the possibility of mining large pools of data remotely, by using small desktop computers, mobile devices and cloud servers, permitting an invasion of privacy on a scale and with previously unimaginable precision.</p>
