<p>Many organisations become more efficient over time because individuals develop standard operating procedures (routines) for producing goods and services. These routines are precise rules, procedures and practices that have been developed to cope with virtually all anticipated scenarios.</p>
<p>As employees learn these routines, they become more productive and efficient and the organisation is able to reduce its costs over time as efficiency increases.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Business processes are collections of routines. </strong><strong>An organisation is a collection of business processes.</strong></p>

<p>People in organisations occupy different positions with different specialties, concerns and perspectives and as a result, they naturally have divergent viewpoints. These differences can result in competition, conflict and political struggles for resources within the organisation.</p>
<p>Political resistance is one of the great difficulties of bringing about organisational change; especially the development of new information systems. The reason for this is that they bring about significant changes in strategy, business objectives, business processes and procedures and can become politically charged events.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_2" class="kl_border_radius_20 kl_panel_heading kl_panel_2" style="background-color: #e3dfda; color: #000000; border-width: 0px;">Organisational Culture</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_2_content" class="kl_border_radius_20 kl_solid_border kl_panel_content kl_panel_2" style="border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; background-color: #f5eede; color: #000000; padding-left: 15px;">
<p>Organisational culture encompasses a set of assumptions about what products the organisation should produce, how it should produce them, where and for whom. Generally, these cultural assumptions are taken for granted and are rarely publicly announced or discussed. Business processes, the actual way business firms produce value, are usually ensconced in the organisation's culture.</p>
<p>Organisational culture is a powerful unifying force that restrains political conflict and promotes common understanding, agreement on procedures and common practices. If we all share the same basic cultural assumptions, agreement on other matters is more likely.</p>
<p>At the same time organisational culture is a powerful restraint on change, especially technological change. Many organisations will do almost anything to avoid making changes. Any technological change that threatens commonly held cultural assumptions usually meets a great deal of resistance. However, there are times when the only sensible way for an organisation to move forward is to employ a new technology that opposes an existing organisational culture. When this occurs, the technology is often stalled while the culture slowly adjusts.</p>

<p>Organisations and environments have a reciprocal relationship. On the one hand organisations are open to and dependent on the social and physical environment that surrounds them. Without financial and human resources or revenue from customers organisations could not exist. Organisations must respond to legislative and other requirements imposed by government as well as the actions of customers and competitors. On the other hand organisations can influence their environments. For example, businesses form partnerships with other businesses to influence the political process; they advertise to influence customer acceptance of their products.</p>
<p>Information systems can help organisations perceive changes in their environments. They are key instruments for environmental scanning, helping managers identify external changes that might require an organisational response.</p>
<p>Environments generally change much faster than organisations. New technologies, new products and changing public tastes and values (many of which result in new government regulations) put strains on any organisation's culture, politics and people.&nbsp;Many organisations are unable to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. Political conflict raised by changes to existing procedures and processes and the threat to a change in culture often inhibits organisations from making significant changes.</p>

<p>Sometimes a technology and resulting business innovation comes along to radically change the business landscape and environment. These innovations are often referred to as "disruptive".</p>
<p><strong>What makes a technology disruptive?<br></strong>Disruptive technologies are often products that perform as well as or better (often much better) than anything currently produced. The car substituted for the horse-drawn carriage, the word processor for typewriters, the Apple iPod and streaming music service for portable CD players and digital photography for process film photography. Table 4.1 describes a few disruptive technologies from the past.</p>
<p>In some cases, entire industries were put out of business or in other cases, disruptive technologies extended the market; usually with more functionality and less cost than existing products. Disk drives are an example: Small hard disk drives used in PCs extended the market by offering cheap digital storage for small files. Eventually, small PC hard disk drives became the largest segment of the disk drive marketplace.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Table 4.1: Technological Innovations and Disruptive Impact</strong></em></p>
<p>Some organisations are able to create technologies and ride the wave to profits; others learn quickly and adapt their business; still others are obliterated because their products, services and business models become obsolete. They may be very efficient at doing what no longer needs to be done! There are also cases where no firms benefit and all the gains go to consumers.</p>
<p>Organisations that invent disruptive technologies as "first movers" do not always benefit if they lack the resources to exploit the technology or fail to see the opportunity. The MITS Altair 8800 is widely regarded as the first PC, but its inventors did not take advantage of their first-mover status. Second movers, so-called "fast followers", such as IBM and Microsoft, reaped the rewards. Citibank's ATMs revolutionised retail banking, but they were copied by other banks. Now all banks use ATMs, with the benefits going mostly to the consumers.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Table 4.2: Mintzberg's Classification of Organisational Structure</em></strong></p>
<p>The kind of information systems you find in an organisation, and the nature of problems with these systems, often reflects the type of organisational structure. For instance, in a professional bureaucracy such as a hospital, it is not unusual to find parallel patient record systems operated by the administration, another by doctors and another by other professional staff such as nurses and social workers. In small entrepreneurial firms, you will often find poorly designed systems developed in a rush that quickly outgrow their usefulness.</p>
