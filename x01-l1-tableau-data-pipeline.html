<p>Before we start using Tableau, let's explore some basic data analysis methods. The first concept to introduce today is the data analysis pipeline.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is a data analysis pipeline?</strong></p>
<p>A data pipeline is a set of steps that we need to follow to ingest raw data from various sources and move the data to a destination, in our case Tableau for storage and analysis. During these steps, we will be able to work with data, including data filtering and exploring relationships.</p>
<p>The data pipeline could include simple processes including data cleaning, extraction and loading, or it may be designed to handle data in a more advanced manner, such as modelling and using machine learning for data analysis. In our case, we will focus on the fundamental aspects of data management using Tableau, including the following steps:</p>
<div id="kl_custom_block_2" class="kl_panels_wrapper kl_panels_accordion">
<h3 id="kl_panel_0" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_0">Using various data sources</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_0_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_0">
<p>Data sources could include relational databases, raw datasets or online data that is under an application programming interface. In this module, we will focus on raw data sources, and we will explore the use of comma-separated values (CSV) files.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_1" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_1">Data storage for analysis</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_1_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_1">
<p>There is a variety of data storage options, including cloud services, data stores or databases. In our case, we will focus on the use of Tableau to store data, so we will simply load files (e.g. by dragging and dropping files).</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_2" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_2">Data cleaning and transformation</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_2_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_2">
<p>This is a key step, prior to any data analysis step. The transformation refers to operations that change data, which may include data standardization, sorting, deduplication, validation, and verification. The ultimate goal is to prepare the dataset for smooth data analysis.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_3" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_3">Data exploration</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_3_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_3">
<p>This step is the first effort to visualise and examine the dataset for possible correlations or identification of patterns in the data. In many cases, data observation can also help in the data cleansing phase. The observation phase usually refers to plotting data to visually identify relationships for the next pipeline step.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_4" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_4">Data querying</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_4_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_4">
<p>At this point, we can start querying the data to explore the hidden knowledge. This includes queries to select and filter data according to different criteria.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_5" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_5">Data visualisations</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_5_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_5">
<p>The data visualisation can help us to conclude the analysis phases and export meaningful visualisations such as bar, line and geographic graphs.</p>

<p>Let's explore the following advantages.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tableau is a data visualization tool first and foremost. Therefore, its technology is there to support complex computations, data blending and dashboarding for the purpose of creating beautiful visualizations that deliver insights that cannot easily be derived from staring at a spreadsheet.</li>
<li>Tableau is ideal for creating interactive visual within minutes. The interface can handle endless variations while also limiting you from creating charts that are against data visualization best practices.</li>
<li>There are many different types of visualization options available in Tableau which enhance the user experience. Also, Tableau is very easy to learn compared to Python or R, anyone without having knowledge of coding can easily learn Tableau.</li>
<li>Tableau can handle millions of rows of data with ease. Different types of visualization can be created with a large amount of data without impacting the performance of the dashboards.</li>
<li>To avoid performance issues and to do complex table calculations in Tableau, users can incorporate &nbsp;Python or R. Using Python script can take the load off the software by performing data cleansing tasks with packages. However, Python is not a native scripting language accepting by Tableau.<br><br></li>

<p>In this module, we will focus on the use of Tableau using CSV files.</p>
<div id="kl_custom_block_1" class="kl_panels_wrapper kl_panels_accordion">
<h3 id="kl_panel_6" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_6">What is a CSV file?</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_6_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_6">
<p><span>A comma-separated values file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. </span> <span>The next figure demonstrates an example of a CSV file called Global Superstore Returns 2016, which includes three columns called Returned, Order ID and Region. As you noticed, a CSV file is similar to an excel spreadsheet.</span></p>

<h3 id="kl_panel_7" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_7">What is a JSON file?</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_7_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_7">
<p>JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a syntax for storing and exchanging data. JSON is mostly used when transmitting data in web applications, and we can use it for data analytics. The following sample dataset demonstrates the JSON syntax for representing the same dataset (<span>Global Superstore Returns 2016). As you observed, a JSON file is structured in a key-value format, where keys represent the column titles, and values represent the associated row data.&nbsp;</span></p>
