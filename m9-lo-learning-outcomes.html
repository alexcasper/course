<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this module, you have seen how to limit outputs (the number of records to be shown in the console) as well as how to offset the output. You have seen how <em>equality</em>, <em>relational</em> and <em>logical operators</em> are employed, and in what order certain expressions are evaluated, and that parentheses can change the order of the evaluation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You have been reminded about the usefulness of the <strong>GROUP BY</strong> and <strong>HAVING</strong> clauses, leading to the usefulness of <strong>subqueries</strong> (sometimes nested!) to better fine tune your SQL statement/query. You have also seen how <strong>MERGE</strong> statements with conditions can be employed for either updating or inserting records into a given table from other tables. You have seen how tables can be joined together via columns and/or rows in order to fine tune your SQL query and thus extract the required item(s) of information from the database.</p>
<p>You have seen that there are inner, outer and self joins for the columns. For the rows, you saw how the use of sets can generate the combined tables; these sets simply link SQL queries together, sometimes in excess of two, to produce an overall output table.</p>
<p>Next, you will take a closer look at data objects such as views, sequences and indexes, and functions, notably single-row and multiple-row functions that can perform specific actions whilst a SQL statement is being executed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;You should now be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand the basic principles of relational databases: their structure, use and how to interrogate them. Basic SQL syntax and query structure. Design and implement basic relational databases.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Explain additional key functions and clauses in SQL for processing tables in a relational database.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code structurally correct SQL commands. Perform basic data manipulation and information retrieval operations using SQL. Demonstrate skill in numeracy and computation. Understand logical arguments, identifying the assumptions made and the conclusions drawn. Demonstrate the ability to analyse, evaluate and correctly interpret data.</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Describe procedures for filtering and sorting data.</li>
<li>Explain methods of joining data from multiple tables.</li>
<li>Describe Sets.</li>
<li>Perform coding in SQL.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not able to confidently discuss the above, you should revisit the material and perform self-directed research.</p>
