<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to using enterprise applications, organisations use technology platforms that increase integration and expedite the flow of information. These applications enable communication between employer and employees and amongst individuals and groups within the organisation.</p>

<p class="kl_border_radius_20 mps-page-subtitle"><img id="66786" src="https://nulondon.instructure.com/courses/2778/files/802182/preview?verifier=3MnaQxI21n0fj3dOyH5K6422SwvBtzNykUVbYwo2" alt="icons_globe.png" data-api-endpoint="https://nulondon.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2778/files/802182" data-api-returntype="File"> Intranets and Extranets</p>
<p>Enterprise applications create deep-seated changes in the way an organisation conducts its business; offering many opportunities to integrate key business data into a single system. They are often costly and difficult to implement. Intranets and extranets deserve mention here as alternative tools for increasing integration and expediting the flow of information within the organisation and with customers and suppliers.</p>
<p>Intranets are internal company websites accessible only by employees. The term intranet refers to an internal network, in contrast to the Internet; a public network linking organisations and other external networks. Intranets use the same technologies and techniques as the larger Internet and are often simply a private access area on a larger company website. Likewise, with extranets, which are company websites that are accessible to authorised external users; enabling businesses to exchange information over the internet in a secure way.</p>

<p><strong>Business Need for Collaboration and Teamwork&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>With all these systems and information, you might wonder how is it possible to make sense of them. How do people working in an organisation pull it all together, work toward common goals and coordinate plans and actions? In addition to the types of systems we have described, businesses need systems to support collaboration and teamwork.</p>
<p>There are suites of software products providing multifunction platforms for collaboration and social business among teams of employees; often working together from many locations. The most widely used are Internet-based audio conferencing and video conferencing systems, cloud collaboration services such as Google's online services and tools, corporate collaboration systems such as Microsoft SharePoint and IBM Notes and enterprise social networking tools such as Salesforce Chatter, Microsoft Yammer, Jive, Facebook Workplace and IBM Connections.<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Enterprise Social Networking&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Many organisations enhance collaboration by embracing social business—the use of social networking platforms, including LinkedIn, Twitter and internal corporate social tools—to engage their employees, customers and suppliers. These tools enable workers to set up profiles, form groups and "follow" each other's status updates. The goal of <strong>social business</strong> is to deepen interactions with groups inside and outside the organisation to expedite and enhance information sharing, innovation and decision making.</p>
