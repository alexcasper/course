<p>&nbsp;We can adopt a number of different perspectives when considering how to approach the study of information platforms:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://view.genial.ly/621c1a66c2fa410019ff6408" width="400" height="400" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>
<p>Developing a cohesive analysis of information systems is not just about analysing, developing or deploying technology. Instead, we need to explore the way that these technology systems interface with organisational structures and decision making processes. An expert in information systems implementation needs to develop a certain amount of <strong>domain knowledge</strong>. For example, a specialist in healthcare information systems should ideally know about the healthcare field. Alternatively, technology specialists working across domains might decide to focus on the technology; if this is the case, they should be able to work effectively with business analysts and area experts.</p>

<p>Michael Porter's 1979 article <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://hbr.org/1979/03/how-competitive-forces-shape-strategy" target="_blank">How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy</a> introduces five forces that affect the success of products and services in the market. While there are five distinct forces, in different scenarios one or more forces may be more significant. A strategy needs to be developed in relation to these five forces.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://view.genial.ly/621c37c3d78bcf00190416e4" width="80%" height="400px" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>In any particular business context, one element might be more pronounced. For example, in an industry that is heavily dependent on a single raw material, keeping the suppliers happy might be the organisation's dominant business concern. In an industry where start-ups with new technologies are prevalent, the threat of new market entrants might be dominant. For luxury goods, catering to customers' changing tastes might be more significant, while for some industries there is a threat that they might be replaced entirely by a different type of offering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this might be obvious, it is often the case that businesses get caught up in analysing their immediate competitors, and are blind to the wider range of threats within their business domain. While this model was developed for traditional industrial production, it certainly can be applied to the production of insights through data analysis, or the production of value through service delivery. It can also be applied to implementation partners, or to platform developers themselves.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The business value chain model allows us to analyse the particular steps involved in creating value. The value chain model highlights specific business activities where competitive strategies can best be applied and where information systems are most likely to have a strategic impact. This model identifies specific, critical leverage points where a firm can use information technology most effectively to enhance its competitive position.</p>
<p>The value chain model views the firm as a series or chain of basic activities that add a margin of value to a firm's products or services. These activities can be categorised as either primary activities or support activities.</p>

<div class="kl_panels_wrapper kl_panels_expander kl_no_expander_controls">
<h3 id="kl_panel_0" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_0"><strong>Primary Activities</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_0_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_0">
<p>Primary activities are most directly related to the production and distribution of the firm's products and services, which create value for the customer.</p>
<p><strong>Primary activities include inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, sales and marketing and service.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Inbound logistics includes receiving and storing materials for distribution to production.</li>
<li>Operations transforms inputs into finished products.</li>
<li>Outbound logistics entails storing and distributing finished products.</li>
<li>Sales and marketing includes promoting and selling the firm's products.</li>
<li>The service activity includes maintenance and repair of the firm's goods and services.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_1" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_1"><strong>Support Activities</strong></h3>
<div id="kl_panel_1_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_1">
<p>Support activities make the delivery of the primary activities possible and consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organisation infrastructure (administration and management)</li>
<li>Human resources (employee recruiting, hiring and training)</li>
<li>Technology (improving products and the production process)</li>
<li>Procurement (purchasing input)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also begin to ask how information systems can be used to improve the relationship with customers and suppliers who lie outside the firm's value chain but belong to the firm's extended value chain where they are absolutely critical to your success. Here, supply chain management systems, that coordinate the flow of resources into your firm, and customer relationship management systems, that coordinate your sales and support employees with customers, are two of the most common system applications that result from a business value chain analysis.</p>
