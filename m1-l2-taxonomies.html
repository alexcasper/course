<p>A taxonomy is a way of organising categorising or classifying things. We all have things we are passionate about, and as we learn more about these things, we find ways to sort and subdivide things.</p>

<p>What taxonomies are you familiar with?</p>

<p>Information systems are no exception. Originally, software systems were limited in their complexity, due to the limitations of what computers could do. As computer and information systems began to be used in a wider variety of industry domains, we started to find ways to divide up systems to better describe their functionality, purpose and audience. Companies with expertise in making a specific type of information system might ultimately choose to enter another space in the market, or create additional functionality, leading to more complex taxonomies.</p>

<p>While information systems can be seen as converging, a key way to differentiate tools is to think about their intended users or <em><strong>audience</strong></em>. The two following types of information system are still prominent, and the distinction is significant enough to mean these terms are still commonly used. Have you heard of these terms? Try to describe them before clicking for a discussion.</p>

<h3 id="kl_panel_1" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_1">Customer Relationship Management (CRM)</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_1_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_1">
<p>A customer relationship management tool is used to aid an organisation in building, maintaining and strengthening relationships with customers. CRM tools may be focused on supporting <em><strong>sales</strong></em>, <em><strong>marketing</strong></em>, or <em><strong>customer service</strong></em>. Effectively, the tool will support customer-facing staff - often called&nbsp;<strong><em>agents</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>- by providing information about the customer and their relationship with the organisation. Customers may contact a company on different channels; where possible, a CRM will support engaging customers on whatever platform they decide to contact the organisation on - known as&nbsp;<em><strong>omnichannel</strong></em> service. Increasingly, parts of the interaction may be automated, whether it is the customer being directed to the right department, or a specific script for the engagement being generated based on the customer history.</p>

<div id="kl_panel_2_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_2">
<p>An enterprise resource planning tool is used to support business operations. Typically, it is <strong>inward-facing</strong>, focusing on provided the technical services that are required by external-facing business services. Organisations use ERP systems, to integrate business processes in manufacturing and production, finance and accounting, sales and marketing and human resources into a single software system.&nbsp;Information that was previously fragmented in disparate systems is stored in a single comprehensive data repository where it can be used by many different areas of the business.</p>

<p>Another frequent way that information systems have historically been broken down has been the area of the decision structure that they were targeted at. Ultimately, there was a division between <strong>operational </strong>or <strong>transactional</strong>&nbsp;systems, used in day to day operations by frontline staff to deal with specific transactions, and <strong>strategic</strong> systems used by top-level managers for long term planning. In larger organisations, mid-level&nbsp;<strong>tactical&nbsp;</strong>systems were also employed. Often data architects would be involved to pull the information out of one platform and put it into another. While operational systems required day to day details about specific items, this data could be grouped together or aggregated for the higher level-systems, reducing the amount of data they needed to process or store.</p>

<p>The following textbook talks about a number of different types of information systems available, with a particular focus on business and manufacturing. Since this chapter is from five years ago, the distinction between different systems is more pronounced. We also see a hierarchy, with certain types of systems being of greater use to front line workers, and other types only of interest to executives. The section also hints at possible transformations due to the implementations of artificial intelligence.</p>
