<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In almost every industry, you will find some firms that do better than others. There's almost always a standout firm. In the car industry, Toyota is considered a superior performer. In pure online retail, Amazon is the leader. In online music, Apple's iTunes is considered the leader with more than 60 percent of the downloaded music market. In web search, Google is considered the leader.</p>
<p>Firms that "do better" than others are said to have a competitive advantage. They often have either access to special resources that others do not or they are able to use commonly available resources more efficiently; usually because of superior knowledge and information assets.</p>
<p>But why do some firms do better than others and how do they achieve competitive advantage? How can you analyse a business and identify its strategic advantages? How can you develop a strategic advantage for your own business? And how do information systems contribute to strategic advantages?</p>
<p>One answer to that question <strong>is Michael Porter 's Competitive Forces model</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Porter’s Competitive Forces Model&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The most widely used model for understanding competitive advantage is Michael Porter's competitive forces model. This model provides a general view of the firm, its competitors and the firm's environment.</p>
<p>In Porter’s competitive forces model, the strategic position of the firm and its strategies are determined not only by competition with its traditional direct competitors but also by four other forces in the industry’s environment; new market entrants, substitute products, customers and suppliers.</p>

<p>What does a firm do when it is faced with all these competitive forces? How can the firm use information systems to counteract some of these forces? How do you prevent substitutes and inhibit new market entrants?</p>
<p>There are four generic strategies, each of which often is enabled by using information technology and systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>low-cost leadership</li>
<li>product differentiation</li>
<li>focus on market niche</li>
<li>strengthening customer and supplier intimacy</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Low-Cost Leadership</strong></p>
<p>Use information systems to achieve the lowest operational costs and the lowest prices.</p>
<p><strong><a id="kl_popup_0_trigger" class="kl_modal_trigger kl_popup_trigger bs-btn bs-btn-primary" href="#kl_popup_0_content">Example – Walmart</a></strong></p>
<div id="kl_popup_0_content" class="kl_modal_content kl_popup_content" style="border: 1px solid #A9A9A9; background: #f7f7f7; padding: 10px; width: 600px; max-width: 100%; margin: auto;">
<h4 class="kl_modal_title" style="margin-top: 0;">Example – Walmart</h4>
<p>By keeping prices low and shelves well-stocked using a legendary inventory replenishment system, Walmart became the leading retail business in the United States. Walmart's continuous replenishment system sends orders for new merchandise directly to suppliers as soon as consumers pay for their purchases at the till. Point-of-sale terminals record the bar code of each item passing the checkout counter and send a purchase transaction directly to a central computer at Walmart headquarters. The computer collects the orders from all Walmart stores and transmits them to suppliers. Suppliers can access Walmart's sales and inventory data using web technology.</p>
<p>Because the system replenishes inventory with speed, Walmart does not need to spend much money on maintaining large inventories of goods in its own warehouses. The system also enables Walmart to adjust purchases of store items to meet customer demands.</p>
<p>Walmart's replenishment system is also an example of an efficient customer response system as it directly links consumer behaviour to distribution and production and supply chains.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Product Differentiation&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Use information systems to enable new products and services or greatly change the customer convenience in using your existing products and services.</p>
<p><a id="kl_popup_1_trigger" class="kl_modal_trigger kl_popup_trigger bs-btn bs-btn-primary" href="#kl_popup_1_content">&nbsp;Example -&nbsp; Google</a><strong></strong></p>
<div id="kl_popup_1_content" class="kl_modal_content kl_popup_content" style="border: 1px solid #A9A9A9; background: #f7f7f7; padding: 10px; width: 600px; max-width: 100%; margin: auto;">
<h4 class="kl_modal_title" style="margin-top: 0;">Example -&nbsp; Google</h4>
<p>Big Tech firms like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and others are pouring billions of dollars into research and deployment of new services and enhancements to their most valuable services and products in order to differentiate them from potential competitors.&nbsp; In 2018 Google updated its Google Assistant to enable more natural continuous conversations and smart displays that can display the output of Assistant to screens. Google added Assistant support to its core Google Maps service to make interaction with Maps more natural and released a Machine Language Kit for developers that supports text recognition, face detection, image labelling and landmark recognition. The continual stream of innovations flowing from Big Tech companies ensures their products are unique and difficult to copy.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Focus on the Market Niche&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Use information systems to enable a specific market focus and serve this narrow target market better than competitors. Information systems support this strategy by producing and analysing data for finely tuned sales and marketing techniques. Information systems enable companies to analyse customer buying patterns, tastes and preferences closely so they can efficiently pitch advertising and marketing campaigns to smaller and smaller target markets.</p>
<p><strong><a id="kl_popup_2_trigger" class="kl_modal_trigger kl_popup_trigger bs-btn bs-btn-primary" href="#kl_popup_2_content">Example -&nbsp; Hilton Hotels</a>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<div id="kl_popup_2_content" class="kl_modal_content kl_popup_content" style="border: 1px solid #A9A9A9; background: #f7f7f7; padding: 10px; width: 600px; max-width: 100%; margin: auto;">
<h4 class="kl_modal_title" style="margin-top: 0;">Example -&nbsp; Hilton Hotels</h4>
<p>Hilton's <strong>OnQ</strong> system analyses detailed data collected on active guests in all of its properties to determine the preferences of each guest and each guest's profitability. Hilton uses this information to give its most profitable customers additional privileges, such as late checkouts. Customer relationship management (CRM) systems feature analytical capabilities for this type of intensive data analysis.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strengthen Customer and Supplier Intimacy&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Use information systems to tighten linkages with suppliers and develop intimacy with customers.</p>
<p><strong><a id="kl_popup_3_trigger" class="kl_modal_trigger kl_popup_trigger bs-btn bs-btn-primary" href="#kl_popup_3_content">Example – Suppliers</a></strong></p>
<div id="kl_popup_3_content" class="kl_modal_content kl_popup_content" style="border: 1px solid #A9A9A9; background: #f7f7f7; padding: 10px; width: 600px; max-width: 100%; margin: auto;">
<h4 class="kl_modal_title" style="margin-top: 0;">Example - Suppliers</h4>
<p>Toyota, Ford and other car manufacturers use information systems to facilitate direct access by suppliers to production schedules and even permit suppliers to decide how and when to ship supplies to their factories. This allows suppliers more lead time in producing goods.</p>
