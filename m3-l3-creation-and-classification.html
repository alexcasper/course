<p>Incidents are reported by a number of means; historically, technology support staff would be located in part of a physical office. As people would come to them to resolve problems, this lead to many organisations adopting a service desk, a first port of call for issues. Technology departments would also be accessible by telephone, but often calls would be directed to the wrong member of staff, or to someone who was away from their desk. Having a regularly staffed, single location and number allows for incidents to be caught and actioned in a more responsible way. Incident management as a methodology prescribes using a standardised process to record, classify, track and resolve incidents. As end users might not necessarily know the best way to record or classify their incident, service desk agents will help them record the problem, asking any relevant questions to ensure enough details about the incident are recorded.</p>
<p>A service desk is not the only means by which incidents can be created, as tools to monitor hardware, software and networks are available. Monitoring of these tools could be done manually by technology staff - such as staff working in a Network or Security Operations Centre (NOC or SOC). Increasingly however these tools are integrated with service management platforms. It is possible for us to discover configuration management hardware and software on our networks, through a process known as discovery. We can also use the event management functionality to record and action alerts coming from our monitoring systems. While this is beyond the scope of this course, incidents are no longer always created through the service desk.</p>
<p>Increasingly, new developments allow incidents to be created with less human involvement. Service Portal, which we saw in the last module as a means to make requests, also frequently will feature an option for end users to register an incident. Some further categorisation may need to be done by a service desk agent, but this is frequently faster and avoids waiting on the caller side. Many organisations are also experimenting with using virtual agents or 'chatbots' to allow people in an organisation to report an incident or receive guidance in a more conversational way.</p>

<p><em><strong>Complete the create an incident record exercise in the simulator.&nbsp;</strong></em>In this task, you will simulate logging in as a support agent to record an issue being raised by a caller. As you are a user with technician permissions - called itil in recognition of the guiding methodology of the platform - you will be able to add a category and subcategory, as well as a description and a short description. Filling this out in a responsible way is incredibly important, as this will allow other technicians to understand the nature of the incident. It would also be possible at this point to associate the incident with another, similar incident as a child or parent incident, meaning that if many users experience the same issue simultaneously, the relevant incidents can be resolved together. It is important, however, that the same incident affecting the same user is not logged twice.</p>
<p><em><strong>Complete the update an incident record exercise in the simulator.</strong>&nbsp;</em>Following the initial recording of the incident, a service desk agent or technician may further adjust an incident, changing the category or subcategory as more information becomes available. They will set an urgency for the item - representing how quickly the service failure will disrupt regular operations - and impact - determining how significantly the organisation will be affected. Organisations will need to train IT staff to consistently evaluate incidents - though it is certainly possible for an incident to be revaluated, doing so will affect service level agreement timers, for example. Taken together, the urgency and impact are used to calculate a priority for the incident. With impact, urgency, and priority lower numbers are more serious; a priority one incident has the potential to cause significant disruption.</p>
<p>Though it is beyond the scope of this course, technology service departments may have a system in place to declare a major incident. These incidents will typically require significant resources to be dedicated towards resolving the service failure, and may have their own special processes, tools and even physical spaces to help resolution.
