<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Organisations and Information systems have a mutual influence on each other. </strong></p>
<p>The information needs of an organisation affect the design of information systems, whilst at the same time the organisation must be aware of, and open to the influences of, information systems in order to benefit from new technologies.</p>
<p>The interaction between information technology and organisations is influenced by many factors, including the organisation's structure, business processes, politics, culture, surrounding environment and management decisions.</p>
<p>If you understand your business organisation, you will be in a better position to understand existing systems and design new systems more successfully.&nbsp;Some changes that occur in businesses, because of information technology (IT) investments, cannot be foreseen and have results that may or may not meet your expectations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Building new information systems or redesigning existing ones often involves changing the organisational balance of rights, privileges, obligations, responsibilities and feelings that have been established over a long period of time.&nbsp;Changing these elements can take a long time, be very disruptive and require more resources to support training and learning. The length of time to implement a new information system effectively is often longer than anticipated because there is a lag between implementing the system and teaching employees how to use the system effectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A change in technology often requires a change in who owns and controls information, who has the right to access and update that information and who makes decisions about whom, when and how. This more complex view forces us to look at the way work is designed and the procedures used to achieve outputs.</span></p>
