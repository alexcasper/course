<br>
<p>In order to operate, businesses must deal with many different pieces of information about suppliers, customers, employees, invoices, payments and, of course, their products and services. They must organise work activities that use this information to operate efficiently and enhance the firm's overall performance.</p>
<p class="mps-highlight"><strong>Information systems</strong> make it possible for firms to manage all their information, make better decisions and improve the execution of their business processes.</p>
<p class="mps-highlight"><strong>Business processes</strong> refer to the manner in which work is organised, coordinated and focussed to produce a product or service. They are a collection of activities supported by flows of information and knowledge among the business process participants.</p>
<p>To a large extent, <strong>an organisation's performance depends on how well its business processes are designed and coordinated.</strong> These processes can be a source of competitive strength if they enable the company to innovate or to execute better than its rivals.</p>
<p><strong>Business processes can also be liabilities if they are based on inefficient working methods</strong> that impede organisational responsiveness and efficiency. Many business processes are tied to a specific functional area; others cross many functional areas and require coordination across departments. Table 1 below describes typical business processes for functional areas of the business.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Table 3.1: Examples of Functional Business Processes</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example of a Cross-Functional Process&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The seemingly simple business process of fulfilling a customer order is a good example of a cross-functional process. Initially, the sales department receives a sales order:</p>
<p>The order passes first to accounting to ensure the customer can pay for the order either by a credit verification or request for payment prior to shipping. Once the customer credit is established, the production department pulls the product from inventory or produces the product. The product is then shipped and this may require working with a logistics firm. The accounting department generates a bill or invoice and a notice is sent to the customer indicating that the product has shipped. The sales department is notified of the shipment and prepares to support the customer by answering calls or fulfilling warranty claims.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Figure 3.1: Cross-Functional Process</em></strong></p>
<p>What at first appears to be a simple process, fulfilling an order, turns out to be a very complicated series of business processes that require the close coordination of major functional groups in a firm. Moreover, to efficiently perform all these steps in the order fulfilment process requires a great deal of information. The required information must flow rapidly within the firm from one decision-maker to another; with business partners, such as delivery firms; and with the customer. Information systems make this possible.</p>

<p>Exactly how do information systems improve business processes? Information systems automate many steps in business processes formerly performed manually, such as checking a client's credit or generating an invoice and shipping order. But today, information technology can do much more. New technology can actually change the flow of information, making it possible for many more people to access and share information, replacing sequential steps with tasks that can be performed simultaneously and eliminating delays in decision-making. New information technology frequently changes the way a business works and supports new business models.</p>
