<i class="fas fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"> </i> Case Study - Changes in the Financial Industry: Adyen and Fintech</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. According to Adyen, the payments platform has two advantages compared to other payment platforms. Describe these advantages in your own words.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Adyen says that it makes payments processing easier by integrating several stages of the financial transaction into one platform. In "traditional" payment chains, several companies need to work together to make a payment successful. The first is, of course, the merchant or the company that needs to be paid for the goods or services provided. Other companies provide a gateway for the payment, still more assess the risk of the payment, and so on. In an ideal world, this would not be a problem, but in reality, coordinating across these various companies is challenging. Some companies may use outdated data systems or systems that simply cannot communicate with those of other companies. Because of this, around 10 percent of payments fail even though the client has—from a purely financial point of view—enough funds to pay for the transaction. Adyen claims that integration of the various elements of the payment cycle into one platform reduces this failure rate considerably.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The second advantage of Adyen is that the platform communicates and coordinates with a large number of payment systems used all over the world. As is clear from the case, payment systems differ from country to country. In some countries, most people use credit cards for online shopping. In other countries, payments are more often linked to debit cards. As shopping is becoming increasingly international, multinational merchants need to provide an easy payments platform that can be used in all the countries in which they are active. Adyen provides such a system, which is one of the reasons why the company has been very successful in recent years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Many fintech companies are very valuable on the stock exchange even though they make little or no profit. Explain this situation. Why do investors pay so much for shares of companies that hardly make any profits?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are two different ways of looking at this. A more cynical view is that investors—like other people—fall victim to hype. To put it simply: they put their money in fintech even though many fintech companies are not making profits yet. Other industry leaders would disagree, emphasizing that the world is changing rapidly and that it is necessary for investors to look toward the future. Fintech companies may not make a lot of profits today, but that is likely to change rapidly. Given that today an increasing number of people shop online and shop across borders, a company like Adyen holds huge business potential. In a world where no one has the time to go to a physical bank and everyone has a smartphone, a bank like N26 has great potential as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Explain why such a high percentage of fintech start-ups go&nbsp; bankrupt before making any profits at all.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are several reasons for this. First, the managers of these start-ups need to convince investors that they have a promising new business idea. Persuading people is an art in itself, so if the managers are not good at convincing investors, they may not get the necessary funds to start or expand the company. Second, it may take a long time for a new company to start generating profits. Investors have to stay calm during this initial period and keep believing in the future profitability of the new company. Third, some new ideas simply do not work in all contexts; banking online, for instance, will never be profitable in a country where people prefer cash payments for deep-rooted cultural reasons</p>
