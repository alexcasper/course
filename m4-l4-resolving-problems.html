<p>Resolving problems involves a slightly different process than with incidents. While incidents typically have a specific caller or end-user who has reported an incident, problems are investigations that are initiated internally. As such, it is up to the department for determining the criteria by which a problem is considered resolved. Frequently, a change will need to be made to an installed system or delivered service - in this case a change request will need to be made. Often it will not be possible to fix a problem - this may be because a fault in some piece of software or hardware needs to be fixed by an external vendor. Alternatively, there may be a fundamental incompatibility between two different technologies. In some cases, the potential cost or risk resulting from attempting to resolve the problem is higher than the cost or risk from the problem itself - in this case it is often advisable to accept the risk.</p>

Fix notes will capture what is being done to fix the problem.</p>

In this case, we will create a normal change, which goes through a less urgent process. Change requests will be explored further in the next module.</p>

Unlike incidents, however, it is not necessary for a caller to approve the closure of a problem, as problems are created and worked behind the scenes. Another difference is that should a problem re-emerge after supposedly being fixed, it is acceptable to reopen the problem by using 'Re-Analyze'. While a new service disruption would be a new incident even if it exhibits similar symptoms, problem analysts can pick up where they left off.</p>
