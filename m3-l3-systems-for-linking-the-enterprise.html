<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting different kinds of systems in a company to work together can prove a major challenge. Typically, organisations evolve through "organic" growth and /or through acquisition of smaller companies. Over time, organisations end up with a collection of systems and have the challenge of getting them to "talk" to one another and work together as one corporate system.&nbsp; One solution to this problem is to implement enterprise applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="kl_border_radius_20 mps-page-subtitle"><img id="71025" src="https://nulondon.instructure.com/courses/2778/files/802518/preview?verifier=rphKD1Dvv6DOgRCjBZroeu8AvLxatwydJmqyF2rh" alt="icon_application.png" data-api-endpoint="https://nulondon.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2778/files/802518" data-api-returntype="File"> Enterprise Applications</p>
<p>Enterprise applications are systems that span functional areas, focus on executing business processes across the firm and include all management levels.</p>
<p>Enterprise applications help businesses become more flexible and productive by coordinating their business processes more closely and integrating groups of processes, so they focus on efficient management of resources and customer service.</p>
<p>Below are four major enterprise applications:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enterprise systems or enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems</li>
<li>Supply chain management (SCM) systems</li>
<li>Customer relationship management (CRM) systems</li>
<li>Knowledge management systems (KMS)</li>
</ol>
<p>These applications pull information from many parts of the organisation and integrate functions and business processes to aid decision making and enhance the organisation’s performa<span style="color: #000000;">nce. The image below shows how enterprise systems, incorporating data from multiple sources,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #2dc26b;"><span style="color: #000000;">enable cross-functional business processes; both internally as well as with suppliers and customers</span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&nbsp;<em>Figure 3.7: Enterprise Application Architecture</em></strong></p>
<p>Let’s have a closer look at four types of enterprise applications.</p>
<p><strong>Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organisations use ERP</strong><strong>&nbsp;systems, to integrate business processes in manufacturing and production, finance and accounting, sales and marketing and human resources into a single software system.</strong> Information that was previously fragmented in disparate systems is stored in a single comprehensive data repository where it can be used by many different areas of the business.</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="kl_popup_0_trigger" class="kl_modal_trigger kl_popup_trigger bs-btn bs-btn-primary" href="#kl_popup_0_content">Example – ERP&nbsp;</a></p>
<div id="kl_popup_0_content" class="kl_modal_content kl_popup_content" style="border: 1px solid #A9A9A9; background: #f7f7f7; padding: 10px; width: 600px; max-width: 100%; margin: auto;">
<h4 class="kl_modal_title" style="margin-top: 0;">Example – ERP</h4>
<p>When a customer places an order, the order data flows automatically to other parts of the company that are affected by them. The order transaction triggers the warehouse to pick the ordered products and schedule shipment. The warehouse informs the factory to replenish whatever has been depleted. The accounting department is notified to send the customer an invoice. Customer service representatives track the order's progress through every step to inform customers about the status of their orders. All this information can be used to make more-precise and timely decisions about daily operations and longer-term planning.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Supply Chain Management (SCM) Systems&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organisations use SCM systems to help manage relationships with their suppliers. </strong>These systems help suppliers, purchasing firms, distributors and logistics companies share information about orders, production, inventory levels and delivery of products and services so they can source, produce and deliver goods and services efficiently.</li>
<li>The ultimate objective is to get the right amount of products from source to point of consumption in the least amount of time at the lowest cost. These systems increase an organisation's profitability by lowering the costs of moving and making products and by enabling better decisions to be made about how to organise and schedule sourcing, production and distribution.</li>
<li>SCM systems automate information flow across organisational boundaries and enable companies to digitally link to customers and outsource work to other companies.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organisations use CRM systems to help manage their customer relationships.</strong> CRM systems provide information to coordinate&nbsp; the business processes that deal with customers in sales, marketing and service to optimise revenue, customer satisfaction and customer retention. This information helps organisations identify, attract and retain their customers; provide better service to existing customers and increase sales.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Management (KM) Systems&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some organisations are more successful because they have better knowledge about how to create, produce and deliver products and services.&nbsp; <strong>KM systems enable organisations to better manage processes for capturing and applying knowledge and expertise. </strong>These systems collect all relevant knowledge and experience in the organisation and make it available wherever and whenever it is needed to improve business processes and management decisions.&nbsp;This knowledge can be leveraged into long-term strategic benefits.</li>
</ul>
