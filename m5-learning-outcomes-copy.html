<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We started this module by looking into corporate governance, by which business corporations are directed and controlled. IT Governance is a sub-discipline and you were introduced to several IT Governance Frameworks like ISO 38500 and third-party standards.</p>
<p><span>Information technology is continually evolving based on the laws and rules of acceptable conduct. The ease in which information is communicated and copied in online environments poses new challenges related to privacy and intellectual property. The main ethical, social, and political issues information systems raise centre on information rights, property rights, accountability, and quality of life.<br><br>New information technologies and systems have an impact on private and business life.&nbsp; These developments have also impacted legislation, and information systems have to be legally compliant in storing, processing, or transmitting information. We looked, therefore, into UK laws related to information systems and data protection.</span></p>
<p><span>In the next module, you will round up this course and start your practical experience with an information system by getting an introduction and hands-on experience on an industry-recognised platform – ServiceNow.</span></p>
