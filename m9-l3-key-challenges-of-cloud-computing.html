<p><span>Migrating to, or adopting, cloud services can significantly change the way a business operates, with wide-ranging considerations, implications, and challenges. Moving an organisation’s legacy IT into the cloud is complex, because it forces tough decisions about consolidation and standardisation.  &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s look at some of the most critical cloud computing challenges pertaining mostly to cloud consumers that use IT resources located in public clouds.</span></p>

<p class="kl_border_radius_20 mps-page-subtitle"><strong> <img id="93995" src="https://nulondon.instructure.com/courses/2778/files/802044/preview?verifier=n9mZaAoR86kBO0WNz3v61kRebIqNNgc3HHUZSeb9" alt="icon_sad_lock.png" data-api-endpoint="https://nulondon.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2778/files/802044" data-api-returntype="File"></strong>Increased Security Vulnerabilities</p>
<p><span>The moving of business data to the cloud means that the responsibility over data security becomes shared with the cloud provider. The remote usage of IT resources requires an expansion of trust boundaries by the cloud consumer to include the external cloud. It can be difficult to establish a security architecture that spans such a trust boundary without introducing vulnerabilities unless cloud consumers and cloud providers happen to support the same or compatible security frameworks—which is unlikely with public clouds. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another consequence of overlapping trust boundaries relates to the cloud provider’s privileged access to cloud consumer data. The extent to which the data is secure is now limited to the security controls and policies applied by both the cloud consumer and cloud provider. Furthermore, there can be overlapping trust boundaries from different cloud consumers due to the fact that cloud-based IT resources are commonly shared. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The overlapping of trust boundaries and the increased exposure of data can provide malicious cloud consumers (human and automated) with greater opportunities to attack IT resources and steal or damage business data.   </span></p>

<p><span>Cloud consumers are usually allotted a level of governance control that is lower than that over on-premise IT resources. This can introduce risks associated with how the cloud provider operates its cloud, as well as the external connections that are required for communication between the cloud and the cloud consumer. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Consider the following examples: &nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>An unreliable cloud provider may not maintain the guarantees it makes in the SLAs that were published for its cloud services. This can jeopardise the quality of the cloud consumer solutions that rely on these cloud services. &nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Longer geographic distances between the cloud consumer and cloud provider can require additional network hops that introduce fluctuating latency and potential bandwidth constraints. &nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Legal contracts, when combined with SLAs, technology inspections, and monitoring, can mitigate governance risks and issues. A cloud governance system is established through SLAs, given the “as-a-service” nature of cloud computing. A cloud consumer must keep track of the actual service level being offered and the other warranties that are made by the cloud provider. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note that different cloud delivery models offer varying degrees of operational control granted to cloud consumers.</span></p>
