<p>The growth of the internet has made it more common for users to solicit help via the internet. Often, since a lot of interactions will be mediated through websites, integrating the ability to get help into the website itself will save users time. The growth of instant messaging as a popular communication medium has also meant users of all ages are becoming more comfortable with interacting with agents via online chat. Initially, chat applications would have involved communication with human agents. Indeed, in many cases, users prefer interacting with real human agents. At the same time, many simple queries fall into similar patterns. The FAQ, or frequently asked questions, that appears on many websites is indicative of this. Data management systems, that store information about incidents, hardware devices or service requests will often be opened by agents dealing with internal or external customers. As such, the human agent is just a conduit, allowing requests in natural language to be processed and transformed into information requests.</p>
<p>A virtual agent is a chatbot designed to provide meaningful information to end users, or to direct them to the right place to find information or file an incident. Effectively, it is another user interface, but one that centres around written conversation. While voice recognition has made significant advances and is already employed within home automation systems and mobile interfaces, using a text interface is beneficial in a number of ways. It allows the passage of a conversation to be analysed more succinctly, while also making it less obvious that the user is talking to a machine. It also allows slightly more information about the flows of conversations to be collected, and provides for easier integration with other services. As well as being a mechanism to distribute knowledge (in the form of knowledge articles), virtual agent and other conversational interfaces also provides a mechanism by which they can be created.</p>
