<p><strong>Corporate governance is the system by which business corporations are directed and controlled </strong>. In the past, this has mainly concerned:</p>
<ul>
<li>shareholder rights</li>
<li>transparency</li>
<li>board accountability</li>
</ul>
<p>As the value and importance of intellectual assets are significant, boards need to extend the core governance principles of – setting strategic aims, providing strategic leadership, overseeing and monitoring the performance of executive management and reporting to shareholders on their stewardship of the organisation – to the organisation's intellectual capital, information and IT.</p>

<p>IT governance is a subset discipline of corporate governance. It is a process used to monitor and control key IT capability decisions in an attempt to ensure the delivery of value to key stakeholders in an organisation.</p>
<p><span>IT&nbsp;</span>governance&nbsp;is about making decisions in a repeatable structured manner to support investment in and use of IT to achieve an organisation's&nbsp;goals; <span>ensuring IT investments generate business value and mitigate IT risks.</span></p>
<p>The concept of governance recognises that key stakeholders&nbsp;(shareholders, customers, vendors, employees etc.)&nbsp; in an organisation have an ownership stake in the organisation. The management is responsible to these stakeholders.</p>

<p>A framework defines the essential elements underlying a concept.</p>
<p><strong>An IT governance framework:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>defines the ways and methods through which an organisation can implement, manage and monitor IT governance.</li>
<li>provides guidelines and measures to effectively utilise IT resources and processes within an organisation.</li>
<li>defines the principles, rules and processes that enable effective decision-making; including who has the authority to make decisions and how decisions are communicated.</li>
<li>defines the performance measures and reporting requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The IT governance framework must be fit-for-purpose and flexible such that it can readily adapt to the customer's changing business requirements.</p>
<p class="kl_border_radius_20 mps-page-subtitle"><img id="66951" style="max-width: 24px;" src="https://nulondon.instructure.com/courses/2778/files/802026/download?verifier=mN9nDn5zBsIibrZU3oaKZfkJjZpb7et2u4DESjnH" alt="icon_task_list.png" data-api-endpoint="https://nulondon.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2778/files/802026" data-api-returntype="File">ISO/IEC 38500:2015<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>IT governance has an international standard, ISO/IEC 38500:2015 called "Corporate Governance of Information Technologies". The objective of the standard is to provide a framework of principles for organisations to use when evaluating, directing and monitoring the use of IT within the organisation.</p>
<p>It is based on meeting the following six principles:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Responsibility <br></strong>Individuals and groups within an organisation must understand and accept their responsibilities in respect of the supply and demand for IT. They must also have the authority to perform the actions for which they are responsible.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Strategy <br></strong>An organisation's business strategy should take into account current and future IT capabilities. The IT strategy should reflect the requirements and ongoing needs of the organisation's business strategy.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Acquisition <br></strong>IT acquisitions should involve clear and transparent decision making with an appropriate balance between cost, opportunity and risk in both the short and long term.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Performance <br></strong>IT should be fit for purpose with IT systems delivering the planned capacity, capability and levels of service required to meet current and future business requirements. Performance requires ongoing monitoring; IT service management is an example of this principle in action.</li>
<li><strong>Conformance <br></strong>The principle of conformance requires the organisation to ensure that IT complies with all regulatory and contractual requirements and that polices and practices are clearly defined, implemented and enforced.</li>
<li><strong>Human</strong> <strong>behaviour <br></strong>The sixth principle, human behaviour, requires IT policies, practices and decisions to respect human behaviour; including the current and evolving needs of all people involved in the process.<strong><br><br></strong></li>
</ol>

<p>There are a number of information and IT related external management standards that an organisation may choose, be required or be mandated to deploy. Some of the best known and most widely used are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CoBIT </strong>(Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology); this is increasingly internationally accepted as good practice for control over information, IT and related risks.</li>
<li><strong>ITIL&nbsp;</strong>(IT Infrastructure Library); an integrated set of best practice recommendations for IT management. ISO 20000 is the international standard for IT service management and is heavily based on ITIL.</li>
