<p style="text-align: left;">Notifications allow information to flow through an organisation. Effectively, events at the technical level are relatively opaque or difficult to interpret for many users. Similarly, many people will not be accustomed to directly accessing the relevant data platform. They will trust someone else to alert them if there is an issue to resolve, a decision to be made, or a request to approve. The notification system allows for an outward flow of information from the information systems used by the business to the various areas of the business itself. This might be in the form of a detailed report, but just as often it might be as simple as an email or a text message alert. Data can then be routed to the relevant groups and/or area of the business.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Below is a diagram of data flowing through an organisation. traditionally, the data function would wait for reports to be commissioned before working. Other times, they would need to respond to an ad-hoc (instant) request. Sometimes getting the required amount of information or performing effective analysis can take time, leading to reports not arriving in time to make effective decisions.</p>

<p>As a response, many modern information platforms now promote a more active approach, often identified as&nbsp;<em>observability.&nbsp;</em>In a theoretical systems sense, observability is about being able to tell what is going on inside a system from its outputs. As such, notifications provide a practical means for increasing observability. Below are the so-called three-pillars of Observability:</p>
<div class="kl_panels_wrapper kl_panels_expander">
<h3 id="kl_panel_0" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_0">Logging</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_0_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_0">
<p>Logging is simply about recording when an event happens within a system. Effectively, logs allow us to tell what happened, in what order. Logging is often incredibly important for security and accountability. We can establish that certain types of logs will trigger a notification.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_1" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_1">Tracing</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_1_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_1">
<p>Tracing is a form of logging that is associated with a particular running application or process. In some cases, a trace may be a lower level output and contain more fine grained detail about a particular process. In other cases, it will be a result of analysing events and discovering sequence, causality or patterns. Tracing can help us filter information and determine whether to sound the alarm - what is normal in one program or part of a system can be cause for alarm in another.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_2" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_2">Metrics</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_2_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_2">
<p>Metrics are quantitative measures of a system, unlike logs and traces which are text-based. As such, metrics are easier to chart, and it is also easier to set up gradual alarms. It is possible to translate some types of events into metrics by counting them.&nbsp;</p>
