<p>A Solutions Architect is a new role made possible due to the increasing complexity of technical systems, and the complex sets of requirements that need to be unpacked. While it is related to the DevOps movement and the roles associated with it, it differs in that it covers a slightly different set of areas and competencies. Solutions Architecture builds upon the more established role of Technical Architect, but also encompasses some elements of business analysis and user experience design. Often the result of their work will not be a physical software product or hardware installation, but rather an operational service or set of services. Solutions Architecture also overlaps with Data Architecture; often a Solutions Architect will also be responsible for designing how data is collected, processed, analysed and visualised within an organisation.</p>

<p>The Well Architected framework is the means by which AWS defines best practices for the role and practice of Solutions Architecture. It was developed in 2012, and made publicly available in 2015. It currently includes 5 pillars: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency and Cost Optimization. At the same time the framework is not set in stone, and has been updated to reflect both new practices in industry and new capabilities within the AWS platform. It has adapted to feedback from external users of the framework, as well as the accumulated experience of AWS experts.&nbsp; Each pillar has its own Whitepaper attached to it - a whitepaper is a collectively authored document centred around a set of questions that Solutions Architects should be asking themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="kl_panels_wrapper kl_panels_expander kl_no_expander_controls">
<h3 id="kl_panel_0" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_0">Security</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_0_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_0">
<p>Security is a pillar of the framework and is incredibly important, given that users of AWS are responsible for the security of their data and applications in the cloud. The Security Pillar discusses concepts of Identity and Access Management, methods to protect data at rest (as it is stored in a database or S3 bucket) and in transit (as it is transmitted from machine to machine).</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_1" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_1">Reliability</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_1_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_1">
<p>Reliability is another pillar of the framework, and relates to the ability of a service to reliably deliver what is expected of it. This pillar introduces the idea of a workload, a task that a specific architecture needs to complete successfully. In order for an architecture to be reliable, it needs to be able to mitigate the failure of any particular component of the system. Change management needs to be considered, as a system that needs to be taken down for upgrades cannot really be considered as reliable.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_2" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_2">Performance Efficiency</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_2_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_2">
<p>Performance Efficiency is the pillar that relates to deciding what type of resources to use in a production environment, and monitoring these resources to determine they are not under- or over-utilised. Logging and analytics is a critical part of ensuring performance efficiency; interestingly much of the data analytics capacity of the platform has its roots in the need to effectively monitor resources.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_3" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_3">Cost Optimisation</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_3_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_3">
<p>Cost Optimization is a pillar that is surprising for some students, as AWS is trying to reduce the amount of revenue . At the same time, for the cloud to compete with traditional infrastructure it was critical that it be more cost-effective. Small companies that innovate with cloud infrastructure soon become huge companies. This pillar promotes responsibility with resources throughout the company - rather than a single&nbsp;accountant paying the bills for infrastructure, its everyone's responsibility to reduce waste.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_4" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_4">Operational Excellence</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_4_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_4">
<p>Operational Excellence is the newest pillar, added in 2016. At the same time, it is perhaps the most interesting, as it brings in a lot of the ideas from the emergent DevOps movement - the fusion of code development and operations. Operational Excellence promotes the idea of infrastructure as code, where resources are defined using templates. This pillar also brings in ideas of iterative development - where a solution evolves over time - and ideas of incremental, continuous improvements to systems and organisational structures.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As well as the five pillars, AWS has released three lenses - these are applications of the well architected framework to particular domains, such as the Internet of Things, Serverless Applications, the Financial Services Industry or Machine Learning. The pillars can be applied to any 'workload' or solution with some creative thinking. AWS has also released a tool that helps aspiring architects review and evaluate their solutions - it is freely accessible via the AWS console.</p>
