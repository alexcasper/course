<p>Business firms specifically invest heavily in information systems to achieve six strategic business objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Operational excellence</li>
<li>Customer and supplier intimacy</li>
<li>New products, services and business models</li>
<li>Improved decision-making</li>
<li>Survival</li>
<li>Competitive advantage</li>
</ol>
<p>Click each <strong>Example </strong>button to view a real-life example.<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Operational Excellence&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Businesses are continuously seeking to improve the efficiency of their operations to achieve higher profits. Information systems and technology, in general, are some of the most important tools available to decision-makers for achieving high levels of efficiency and productivity throughout business operations, especially when coupled with changing practices and behaviour.</p>
<p><strong><a id="kl_popup_0_trigger" class="kl_modal_trigger kl_popup_trigger bs-btn bs-btn-primary" href="#kl_popup_0_content">Example - Walmart: Achieving Efficiency</a></strong></p>
<div id="kl_popup_0_content" class="kl_modal_content kl_popup_content" style="border: 1px solid #A9A9A9; background: #f7f7f7; padding: 10px; width: 600px; max-width: 100%; margin: auto;">
<h4 class="kl_modal_title" style="margin-top: 0;">Walmart: Achieving Efficiency</h4>
<p>Walmart, the largest retailer on earth, exemplifies the power of information systems coupled with state-of-the-art business practices and supportive management to achieve world-class operational efficiency.</p>
<p>In the fiscal year 2018, Walmart achieved over $500 billion in sales in large part because of its Retail Link system, which digitally links its suppliers to every one of Walmart's stores. As soon as a customer purchases an item, the supplier monitoring the item knows to ship a replacement to the shelf.</p>
<p>Walmart is the most efficient retail store in the industry, achieving sales of more than $600 per square foot, compared with its closest competitor, Target, at $425 per square foot and other large general merchandise retail firms producing less than $200 per square foot.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Customer and Supplier Intimacy</strong></p>
<p>When a business understands its customers and meets their needs, customers will generally respond by returning and purchasing again. The result is an increase in both revenue and profits. This is also true with suppliers. The more a business engages its suppliers, the better the suppliers can provide vital inputs. The result of this engagement is a lower cost of doing business. Information systems help digitally link the supplier to each of its stores worldwide. Suppliers can ensure the continual flow of its products to stores to keep up with customer demands.</p>
<p><strong><a id="kl_popup_1_trigger" class="kl_modal_trigger kl_popup_trigger bs-btn bs-btn-primary" href="#kl_popup_1_content">Example - Mandarin Oriental Group</a></strong></p>
<div id="kl_popup_1_content" class="kl_modal_content kl_popup_content" style="border: 1px solid #A9A9A9; background: #f7f7f7; padding: 10px; width: 600px; max-width: 100%; margin: auto;">
<h4 class="kl_modal_title" style="margin-top: 0;">Mandarin Oriental Group – Personalising Customer Experience</h4>
<p>The Mandarin Oriental hotel group, which operates hotels in Asia, Europe and the Americas, and other high-end hotels - exemplifies the use of information systems and technologies to achieve customer intimacy.</p>
<p>These hotels track guests' preferences, such as preferred room temperature, check-in time, frequently dialled telephone numbers and television programmes, and store this data in a large data repository. When a customer arrives at one of these hotels, the system automatically changes the room conditions, such as dimming the lights, setting the room temperature or selecting appropriate music based on the customer's digital profile. The hotels also analyse their customer data to identify their best customers and to develop individualised marketing campaigns based on customers' preferences.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>New Products, Services and Business Models&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Information systems and technologies have become a major enabler for firms to create new products and services and, in some instances, new business models. A business model is how a company produces, delivers and sells a product or service to create profit. As successful as Target, Best Buy and Walmart were with their traditional brick-and-mortar stores, they have now introduced new products, services and business models that have made them even more competitive and profitable thanks to technology.</p>

<div id="kl_popup_2_content" class="kl_modal_content kl_popup_content" style="border: 1px solid #A9A9A9; background: #f7f7f7; padding: 10px; width: 600px; max-width: 100%; margin: auto;">
<h4 class="kl_modal_title" style="margin-top: 0;">Apple – Transforming Online Music Distribution</h4>
<p>Today's music industry is vastly different from a decade ago. Apple Inc. transformed an old business model of music distribution based on vinyl records, tapes and CDs into an online, legal distribution model based on its own iPod technology platform. Apple has prospered from a continuing stream of innovations, including iTunes music service, the iPad and iPhone.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Improved Decision-Making&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Information systems and technologies have made it possible for decision-makers to use real-time data to make decisions. Previously, decision-makers did not have access to accurate or current data, and as a result, relied on forecasts, guesses and sometimes luck. The inability to make informed decisions, resulted in unhappy employees, increased costs and unhappy customers.</p>
<p><strong><a id="kl_popup_3_trigger" class="kl_modal_trigger kl_popup_trigger bs-btn bs-btn-primary" href="#kl_popup_3_content">Example – Privi Organics Ltd.: Performance Management&nbsp;</a></strong></p>
<div id="kl_popup_3_content" class="kl_modal_content kl_popup_content" style="border: 1px solid #A9A9A9; background: #f7f7f7; padding: 10px; width: 600px; max-width: 100%; margin: auto;">
<h4 class="kl_modal_title" style="margin-top: 0;">Privi Organics Ltd. – Performance Management</h4>
<p>Privi Organics Ltd., a leading Indian company that manufactures, supplies and exports aroma chemical products worldwide, uses the Oracle Human Capital Management system for real-time insight into individual employee information; including performance rating and compensation history. The system helps managers make faster human resource decisions, such as promotions or transfers, by integrating all employee records across the organisation. Managers can quickly review employee performance ratings for the past three years and drill down into more details. A digital dashboard helps management view and monitor the hiring status in multiple locations, such as the number of open positions and the time taken to fill these positions.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Survival&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Firms will also invest in information systems and technologies because they are becoming necessary for doing business. Information systems are no longer a luxury. In many businesses, information systems and technology are the core of survival.</p>
<p><strong><a id="kl_popup_4_trigger" class="kl_modal_trigger kl_popup_trigger bs-btn bs-btn-primary" href="#kl_popup_4_content">Example - Citibank: Competitive Technological Advantage for Survival</a></strong></p>
<div id="kl_popup_4_content" class="kl_modal_content kl_popup_content" style="border: 1px solid #A9A9A9; background: #f7f7f7; padding: 10px; width: 600px; max-width: 100%; margin: auto;">
<h4 class="kl_modal_title" style="margin-top: 0;">Citibank: Competitive Technological Advantage for Survival</h4>
<p>Citibank was the first bank to introduce automated teller machines (ATMs). In doing so, they created a major competitive advantage over their competitors. Other banks had no choice; to remain and survive in the banking industry they had to provide ATM services to banking customers.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Competitive Advantage&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>When firms achieve one or more of the business objectives discussed above, the chances are they have already achieved a competitive advantage. Doing things better than the competitors, charging less for superior products and responding to customers and suppliers in real-time all add up to higher sales and higher profits that a competitor cannot match.</p>

<h4 class="kl_modal_title" style="margin-top: 0;">Amazon: Supply Chain Innovation&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Amazon has changed the face of retail through its use of bold supply chain strategies and the deployment of innovative technologies, e.g. robots. The online retailer's history is one of rapid growth and relentless innovations. It is reshaping the supply chain and leaving competitors scrambling to catch up.</p>
