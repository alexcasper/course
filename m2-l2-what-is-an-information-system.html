<p class="mps-highlight">An information system can be defined, technically, as a set of interrelated components that collect (or retrieve), process, store and distribute information to support decision-making and control in an organisation.</p>
<p>Information systems may also help individuals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyse problems</li>
<li>Visualise complex subjects</li>
<li>Create new products</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Information systems contain information about people, places and things within the organisation or in the environment surrounding it.</strong></p>
<p>A brief example of contrasting information and data may prove useful. Supermarket checkout counters scan millions of pieces of data from bar codes, which describe each product. Such pieces of data can be totalled and analysed to provide meaningful information, such as the total number of bottles of detergent sold at a store, which brands of detergent were selling the most at that store or in the sales territory or the total amount spent on a brand of detergent at that store or sales region.</p>

<p>Three activities in an information system produce the information that organisations need to make decisions, control operations, analyse problems and create new products or services.</p>
<p>These activities can be summarised as input, process and output.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Figure 2.2: Functions of an Information System</em></strong></p>
<p>Feedback systems complete the information systems loop. Feedback from systems and users on the output is returned to appropriate members of the organisation to help them evaluate, correct the input and modify the process, if needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="mps-highlight">
<p><strong>Example – Professional Sports Team</strong></p>
<p>In a professional sports team's system for selling tickets, the raw <strong>input</strong> consists of order data for tickets, such as the purchaser's name, address, credit card number, number of tickets ordered and date of the game for which the ticket is being purchased. Another input would be the ticket price, which would fluctuate based on computer analysis of how much could optimally be charged for a ticket for a particular game.</p>
<p>Computers store all the input data and <strong>process</strong> it to calculate order totals, track ticket purchases and send requests for payment to credit card companies.</p>
<p>The <strong>output</strong> consists of tickets to print, receipts for orders and reports on online ticket orders. The system provides meaningful information, such as the number of tickets sold for a particular game or at a particular price, the total number of tickets sold each year and frequent customers.</p>
