<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Structured Query Language (SQL) is said to be a “4<sup>th</sup> generation language” (4GL).</p>
<p>It is considered to be a “shorthand programming language”. This means that one line of code in 4GL could involve, for example, 37 lines of code in a 3GL (“3<sup>rd</sup> generation language”).</p>
<p>There are currently five generations in total (1GL to 5GL). Please watch the video below for more information.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="kl_panel_0" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_0">1GL – First Generation Language</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_0_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_0">
<p>This is classed as a “low-level” programming language as it communicates directly with the hardware in the form of <em>binary numbers&nbsp; <img class="equation_image" title="\longrightarrow" src="https://nulondon.instructure.com/equation_images/%255Clongrightarrow" alt="LaTeX: \longrightarrow" data-equation-content="\longrightarrow" x-canvaslms-safe-mathml="<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;>

</math>"> <strong>machine language</strong></em>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_1" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_1">2GL – Second Generation Language</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_1_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_1">
<p>This is also classed as a “low-level” programming language in the form of Assembly Code which can be read by humans, but can still be very difficult to understand and follow for humans.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_2" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_2">3GL – Third Generation Language</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_2_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_2">
<p>These are “higher-level” languages that are most importantly “machine-independent”. These can be easily read by humans, although a considerable amount of knowledge is still required to be able to construct/write the programs in the respective languages.</p>
<p>3GL contains some of the following common and popular languages: BASIC, C, Fortran, Pascal, Java, R, Matlab and Python.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_3" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_3">4GL – Fourth Generation Language</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_3_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_3">
<p>These are also “high-level” languages and are much closer to “human language”, for example, making use of ‘common English words’. In SQL, you will see common words like <strong>SELECT</strong>, <strong>FROM</strong>, and <strong>WHERE </strong>very much used!</p>
<p>The 4GLs are more focused on “what” needs doing rather than “how” to do it.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_4" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_4">5GL – Fifth Generation Language</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_4_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_4">
<p>This is deemed to be the “natural language”. The computer is expected to solve the given problem, and not be told how to solve the problem. This is due to making use of “constraints” and/or “logic”.</p>
<p>Examples include Prolog, Mercury and OPS5.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of ‘popularity’, 3GL and 4GL are more employed today. Indeed, the majority of data science, database and software developer roles require the applicant to possess extensive knowledge and experience with the likes of Python, R, SQL and sometimes C++ (and/or Java).</p>
<p>5GL does not appear to be as ‘popular’ today because when it came to formulating an efficient algorithm in order to solve a particular difficult problem, the application of the constraints became a harder problem to overcome for very large ‘constraint-based’ programs.</p>
