<p><span>Investigation of problems will often revolve around further associating them with specific configuration items and services. By charting dependencies between technology services, problem analysts can better determine if the problem is created by an associated service. Similarly, configured items - representing installed software or hardware - can be investigated for potential issues or updates.</span></p>

<p>Following the classification of the problem, it will be put into the Assess stage. It is reviewed by a problem manager to ensure that all preparatory work in categorising the incident has completed, that it is not a duplicate, and it is a valid use of resources.</p>

For example, they may check change requests - if a system is likely to be decommissioned or upgraded in the near future, it is likely less worthwhile to expend the resources in resolving a current problem. If the problem affects a particular service, they may wish to liaise with the service owner, understanding the potential impacts of incidents and determining the effects they are using on a service owner. If a problem is already being investigated, it can be marked as duplicate using 'Mark Duplicate'. If it is not a valid problem, it can be closed using 'Cancel'. To move forward with the problem, an assessor will press 'Confirm', putting the problem into the Root Cause Analysis state.</p>

<p>The Root Cause Analysis stage involves the deep investigation of a problem, all related incidents, changes, services and configuration items. The goal is to determine the underlying cause of incidents, or in some cases, the potential cause of future incidents.</p>
<p>The following video covers the investigation and diagnosis stage, as well as the subsequent stage, resolution and closure.</p>

Problem tasks allow the analysis of a problem to be broken down into discrete steps, that can then be allocated to different groups or individuals according to availability and skill set. Even when a single person is working on analysing a problem, creating a set of discrete tasks allows visibility on the problem analysis process for stakeholders. It also allows for the problem analysis process to be standardised, with a recipe of things to attempt or investigate.</p>

A workaround is a way of restoring service without resolving the underlying problem. In this particular case, their investigation uncovers a potential workaround, which can be registered on the analysis information tab. There are two types of problem tasks - 'general' and 'root cause analysis'. While the former can include looking for workarounds and mitigating symptoms, the latter types of tasks are more concerned with developing a permanent fix for a problem.</p>

Note that in this case, we are not immediately communicating to the end-user, but rather to all technical staff watching the affected incidents. The workaround can then be communicated to end users, restoring service and resolving the incidents.</p>

We will need to enter a cause code, and cause notes, as well as ideally proposing a fix that can be taken forward. Note that different teams working on different tasks may propose different causes and fixes, meaning it is often beneficial to wait until the conclusion of different strands of problem analysis unless there is a clear consensus on the cause.</p>

Creating a known error from a problem will carry over some relevant information from the problem record into the knowledge article. A problem may have been investigated without a feasible cause being identified, or without a possible resolution being found. Note that this is not always because a problem is impossible to fix; sometimes, the disruption, risk or resource cost produced by a proposed resolution may be unacceptable. In this case, a problem can be closed through the 'Accept Risk' button. It can also be identified with another problem after further analysis - at this stage, it is closed through the 'Mark Duplicate' button.</p>
