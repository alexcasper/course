<p>The term ecosystem originates in environmental science, referring to organisms of various sizes, the landscape, and the processes they are involved in. More recently, we have adopted the term to talk about technology platforms; these platforms have an ecosystem that is made up not of landscapes and organisms but organisations and individuals. Below are three core elements of an information system:</p>
<div class="kl_panels_wrapper kl_panels_accordion">
<h3 id="kl_panel_0" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_0">Customers</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_0_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_0">
<p>Customers are users of the information system. They might be individual users, often referred to as&nbsp;<strong>end users</strong>. However, for larger scale information systems, the customer will often be an organisation that is purchasing or subscribing to the system in order to meet one or more organisational goals - an <strong>enterprise</strong>. Customers provide the ultimate test of an information system as they provide the application or context in which the system is used. The customer may seek to configure the system themselves, or they may enlist the help of <strong>i</strong><strong>mplementation partners</strong> or the <strong>platform developers</strong>. While customers may be in direct competition with one another, more often than not they are willing to share at least some of their insights by participating in <strong>case studies.</strong></p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_1" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_1">Developer</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_1_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_1">
<p>Here, we do not mean directly the role of developer - as customers and partners may have developers of their own. Instead, we mean the core developer of the system or information platform. The platform developers are likely to have the most comprehensive understanding of the system as a whole. At the same time, they might be limited due to resource constraints, or due to the lack of knowledge of specific domains where their system might be applied. Platform developers will often have their own training programmes to skill and confidence of new staff. A platform developer might offer a range of products and services, or might release a singular platform.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="kl_panel_2" class="kl_panel_heading kl_panel_2">Partner</h3>
<div id="kl_panel_2_content" class="kl_panel_content kl_panel_2">
<p>The partners are third party organisations with the ability to develop or maintain an information platform on behalf of a customer. Some partners will have used the platform themselves for their own operations, while others may have worked extensively with other information systems and have decided to pivot or increase their capability but introducing new platforms. Partners may specialise in a particular area or region; other partners will work across continents or industries. An individual belonging to a partner is often termed a&nbsp;<strong>consultant</strong>, though many partners will have teams encompassing various skillsets and levels of experience.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>The following are examples of how organisations are using the platform to support their specific requirements. In each case, they are using different parts of the platform - different products.&nbsp;<em>Can you identify what features are used and why? Can you track down similar case studies for a platform you use extensively? (</em>This will be helpful for your formative and written summative assignments.)</p>

<p>Traditionally, people would get to know the technology support staff in their organisation, or would have a recognisable location to go to to get help - perhaps, a physical help-desk. They might be used to picking up the telephone or sending an email. Adopting a new technology platform is going to be difficult for many users; ensuring the information that users receive is filtered to the essentials will help prevent them getting lost. Customising the platform to represent the brand identity of the company will help users feel like they are using something that is an integral part of the company's technology infrastructure.</p>
