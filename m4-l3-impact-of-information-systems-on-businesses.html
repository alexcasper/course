<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The one constant in the relationship between organisations and information systems is change. Technology is constantly evolving and as organisations evolve and change this can impact all aspects of the organisation from&nbsp;the infrastructure all the way through to the services it offers and its customers, employees and suppliers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="kl_border_radius_20 mps-page-subtitle"><img id="71055" src="https://nulondon.instructure.com/courses/2778/files/802074/preview?verifier=kB8f9uePGb7WoX2SjWKsBlVImhiU94iZWxkYhtSr" alt="icons_graph.png" data-api-endpoint="https://nulondon.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2778/files/802074" data-api-returntype="File"> Economic Impacts</p>
<p><strong>Reducing Costs for Labour and Capital</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">From the point of view of economics, IT changes both the relative costs of capital and the costs of information. As the cost of information technology decreases, it is substituted for labour, which historically has been a rising cost. Information technology should result in a decline in the number of middle managers and clerical workers as information technology substitutes for their labour.&nbsp;As the cost of information technology decreases, we should expect managers to increase their investments in IT because of its declining cost relative to other capital investments.</span></p>
<p class=""><strong>Economics of Information – Reducing Transaction Costs&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>IT affects the cost and quality of information and changes the economics of information. Information technology helps firms contract in size because it can reduce transaction costs; the costs incurred when a firm buys products on the marketplace that it cannot make itself. According to transaction cost theory, firms and individuals seek to economise on transaction costs, much as they do on production costs. Using markets is expensive because of costs such as locating and communicating with suppliers, monitoring contract compliance, buying insurance, obtaining information on products and so forth. Traditionally, firms have tried to reduce transaction costs through vertical integration, hiring more employees and buying their own suppliers and distributors.</p>
<p>Information technology, especially the use of networks, can help firms lower the cost of market participation (transaction costs), making it worthwhile for firms to contract with external suppliers instead of using internal sources. As a result, firms can reduce the number of employees because it is often less expensive to outsource work to a competitive marketplace rather than hire employees. For instance, by using computer links to external suppliers, businesses such as Chrysler, Toyota and Honda can achieve economies by obtaining more than 70 percent of their parts externally. Information systems make it possible for companies such as Apple, Cisco Systems and Dell Inc. to outsource the assembly of iPhones to contract manufacturers instead of making their products themselves.</p>
<p>As transaction costs decrease, the number of employees should shrink because it becomes easier and cheaper for the firm to contract for the purchase of goods and services in the marketplace rather than to make the product or offer the service itself.</p>
<p>Firm size can stay constant or contract even as the company increases its revenues. For example, when Eastman Chemical Company split off from Kodak in 1994, it had $3.3 billion in revenue and 24,000 full-time employees. In 2017, it generated $9.5 billion in revenue with only 14,500 employees. Information technology also can reduce internal management costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="mps-highlight">Information technology permits organisations to reduce costs because it becomes easier for managers to oversee a greater number of employees. By reducing overall management costs, information technology enables firms to increase revenues while shrinking the number of middle managers and clerical workers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today’s world, information technology expands the power and scope of small organisations by enabling them to perform coordinated activities such as processing orders or keeping track of inventory with very few employees and managers. Because IT reduces both agency and transaction costs for firms, we should expect a firm size to shrink over time as more capital is invested in IT. Firms will have fewer managers and you can expect to see revenue per employee increase over time.</p>

<p>Theories based in the sociology of complex organisations provide some understanding about how and why firms change with the implementation of new IT applications.</p>
<p><strong>IT Flattens Organisations</strong></p>
<p>Behavioural researchers have theorised that information technology facilitates the flattening of hierarchies by broadening the distribution of information to empower lower-level employees and increase management efficiency.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img id="71012" class="kl_image_max_fill kl_image_align_center" src="https://nulondon.instructure.com/courses/2778/files/802092/download?verifier=HoKHcNcqh9yImopOvlxbgzWX5qLjsIYsCkJ7IZxR" alt="4.6_Flattening_Organisations.jpg" data-api-endpoint="https://nulondon.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2778/files/802092" data-api-returntype="File"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Figure 4.2: Flattening Organisations</em></strong></p>
<p>IT pushes decision-making rights lower in the organisation because lower-level employees receive the information they need to make decisions without supervision. Because managers receive much more accurate information on time, they become faster at making decisions, so fewer managers are required. Management costs decline as a percentage of revenues and the hierarchy becomes much more efficient.</p>
<p>These changes mean that the management span of control has also been broadened, enabling high-level managers to manage and control more workers. Many companies have eliminated thousands of middle managers as a result of these changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Organisational Resistance to Change</strong></p>
<p>Information systems (IS) often become bound up in organisational politics because they influence access to a key resource; information. IS can affect who does what to whom, when, where and how in an organisation. Many IS require changes in individual routines that can be painful for those involved and require retraining and additional effort that may or may not be compensated. Because IS potentially change an organisation's structure, culture, business processes and strategy, there is often considerable resistance to them when they are introduced.</p>
<p>Research on organisational resistance to innovation suggests that four factors are paramount: the nature of the IT innovation, the organisation's structure, the culture of people in the organisation and the tasks affected by the innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><img id="71013" class="kl_image_max_fill kl_image_align_center" src="https://nulondon.instructure.com/courses/2778/files/802496/download?verifier=pkR5NTvPSzHbt3vSaX8ntFsS5Hl9fTE4fxTElsoa" alt="4.7_Organisational_Resistance_Innovations.jpg" data-api-endpoint="https://nulondon.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2778/files/802496" data-api-returntype="File"></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Figure 4.3: Organisational Resistance to Information System Innovations</em></strong></p>
<p>Here, changes in technology are absorbed, interpreted, deflected and defeated by organisational task arrangements, structures and people. In this model, the way to bring about change is to change the technology, tasks, structure and people simultaneously.</p>
