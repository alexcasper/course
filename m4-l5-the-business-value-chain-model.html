<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the Porter Competitive Forces model helps identify competitive forces and suggest generic strategies, it is not specific and it does not provide a methodology to follow for achieving competitive advantages. If your goal is to achieve operational excellence, where do you start? Here's where the business value chain model is helpful.</p>
<p>The value chain model highlights specific business activities where competitive strategies can best be applied and where information systems are most likely to have a strategic impact. This model identifies specific, critical leverage points where a firm can use information technology most effectively to enhance its competitive position.</p>
<p>The value chain model views the firm as a series or chain of basic activities that add a margin of value to a firm's products or services. These activities can be categorised as either primary activities or support activities.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Primary Activities&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Primary activities are most directly related to the production and distribution of the firm's products and services, which create value for the customer.</p>
<p><strong>Primary activities include inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, sales and marketing and service. </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Inbound logistics includes receiving and storing materials for distribution to production.</li>
<li>Operations transforms inputs into finished products.</li>
<li>Outbound logistics entails storing and distributing finished products.</li>
<li>Sales and marketing includes promoting and selling the firm's products.</li>
<li>The service activity includes maintenance and repair of the firm's goods and services.<br><br></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Support Activities&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Support activities make the delivery of the primary activities possible and consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organisation infrastructure (administration and management)</li>
<li>Human resources (employee recruiting, hiring and training)</li>
<li>Technology (improving products and the production process)</li>
<li>Procurement (purchasing input)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you ask at each stage of the value chain<strong>, "How can we use information systems to improve operational efficiency and improve customer and supplier intimacy?",</strong> this will force you to critically examine how you perform value-adding activities at each stage and how the business processes might be improved.</p>
<p>You can also begin to ask how information systems can be used to improve the relationship with customers and suppliers who lie outside the firm's value chain but belong to the firm's extended value chain where they are absolutely critical to your success. Here, supply chain management systems, that coordinate the flow of resources into your firm, and customer relationship management systems, that coordinate your sales and support employees with customers, are two of the most common system applications that result from a business value chain analysis.</p>
