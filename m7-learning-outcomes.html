<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should now understand what a database is and what it consists of along with what it can be used for.</p>
<p>You have also been introduced to the database management system (DBMS) and the key role played by it in accessing and processing the data stored in a database.</p>
<p>You have also been presented with the types of architectures and schemas employed to define a database and how there are typically three levels: external (user), conceptual (logical) and internal (physical). You have seen the importance of schemas in helping to design a database taking into account the conceptual, logical and physical considerations.</p>
<p>You have been introduced to the security requirements of both the database and the computer system, along with the ethics and regulations applicable to IT systems and databases.</p>
<p>In the next module, you will be introduced to programming using SQL (Structured Query Language). You will use SQL to insert, update or delete data from a table within a relational database. You will also apply your knowledge to a small challenge so that your SQL coding skills can be enhanced.</p>

<p>You should now be able to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand </strong><strong>the basic principles of relational databases: their structure, use and how to interrogate them.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Explain database in relation to its design and its use in the storage of different types of data.</li>
<li>Explain how to manage a relational database.</li>
<li>Identify the different environments of a relational database.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Have knowledge of the regulations, ethical and security considerations required in modern data storage.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Detail the ethical considerations concerning the processing of data within a relational database.</li>
<li>Be mindful of the security aspects required to keep information safe on a database.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not able to confidently discuss the above you should revisit the material and perform self-directed research.</p>
<p>We have an update to the format of this page for our courses, weâ€™ll need to include the Apprenticeship objectives followed by the Module learning outcomes on the summary page.</p>
