<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The major ethical, social and political issues that information systems raise include the following moral dimensions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Information rights</li>
<li>Property rights and obligations</li>
<li>Accountability and control</li>
<li>System quality</li>
<li>Quality of life</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's get into more detail.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information rights and obligations </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>What information rights do individuals and organisations possess with respect to themselves? What can they protect?</strong></em></p>
<p>Privacy is the claim of individuals to be left alone, free from surveillance or interference from other individuals or organisations, including the government. Claims to privacy are also involved at the workplace. Millions of employees are subject to digital and other forms of high-tech surveillance. Information technology and systems threaten individual claims to privacy by making the invasion of privacy cheap, profitable and effective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Property rights and obligations</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>How will traditional intellectual property rights be protected in a digital society in which tracing and accounting for ownership are difficult and ignoring such property rights is so easy?</strong></em></p>
<p>Intellectual property is defined as tangible and intangible products of the mind created by individuals or corporations.&nbsp;Information systems have severely challenged existing laws and social practices that protect intellectual property. IT has made it difficult to protect intellectual property because computerised information can be easily copied or distributed on networks. Intellectual property is subject to a variety of protections under four legal traditions: copyright, patents, trademarks and trade secrets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Accountability and control </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Who can and will be held accountable and liable for the harm done to individual and collective information and property rights?</strong></em></p>
<p>Along with privacy and property laws, new information technologies are challenging existing liability laws and social practices for holding individuals and institutions accountable. If a person is injured by a machine controlled, in part, by software, who should be held accountable and, therefore, held liable?</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>System quality </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>What standards of data and system quality should we demand to protect individual rights and the safety of society?</strong></em></p>
<p>The debate over liability and accountability for unintentional consequences of system use raises a related dimension: What is an acceptable, technologically feasible level of system quality? At what point should system managers say, "Stop testing, we've done all we can to perfect this software. Release it!"</p>
<p>Individuals and organisations may be held responsible for avoidable and foreseeable consequences, which they have a duty to perceive and correct. The grey area is that some system errors are foreseeable and correctable only at very great expense, expense so great that pursuing this level of perfection is not feasible economically—no one could afford the product.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quality of life </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>What values should be preserved in an information and knowledge-based society? Which institutions should we protect from violation? Which cultural values and practices does the new information technology support?</strong></em></p>
<p>The danger of ubiquitous computing, telecommuting, nomad computing, mobile computing and the do-anything-anywhere computing environment is that it is actually coming true. The traditional boundaries that separate work from family and just plain leisure have been weakened. The explosive growth and use of smartphones heightened the sense of many employees that they are never away from work.</p>
