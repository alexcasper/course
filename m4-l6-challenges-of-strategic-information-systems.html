<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strategic information systems often change the organisation as well as its products, services and operating procedures, driving the organisation into new behavioural patterns. Successfully using information systems to achieve a competitive advantage is challenging and requires precise coordination of technology, organisations and management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="kl_border_radius_20 mps-page-subtitle"><img id="71045" src="https://nulondon.instructure.com/courses/2778/files/802086/download?verifier=8KyWxUOuFauFPiWuWhvyghMJ74vTzfQloqd6DRN5" alt="icon_triangle.png" data-api-endpoint="https://nulondon.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2778/files/802086" data-api-returntype="File"> Sustaining Competitive Advantage</p>
<p>The competitive advantages that strategic systems provide do not necessarily last long enough to ensure long-term profitability. Because competitors can retaliate and copy strategic systems, competitive advantage is not always sustainable. Markets, customer expectations and technology change; globalisation has made these changes even more rapid and unpredictable. The Internet can make competitive advantages disappear very quickly because virtually all companies can use this technology. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Classic strategic systems, such as American Airlines's SABRE computerised reservation system, Citibank's ATM system and FedEx's package tracking system, benefited by being the first in their industries. Then rival systems emerged. Amazon was an e-commerce leader but now faces competition from eBay, Walmart and Google.</p>
<p>Information systems alone cannot provide an enduring business advantage. Systems originally intended to be strategic frequently become tools for survival, required by every firm to stay in business, or they may inhibit organisations from making the strategic changes essential for future success.</p>

<p>The research on IT and business performance has found that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the more successfully a firm can align information technology with its business goals, the more profitable it will be and</li>
<li>only one-quarter of firms achieve alignment with the business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many businesses get it wrong: Information technology can take on a life of its own and end up not serving management and shareholder interests very well. Instead of businesspeople taking an active role in shaping IT to the enterprise, they ignore it, claim not to understand IT and tolerate failure in the IT area as just a nuisance to work around. Such organisations pay a hefty price in poor performance. Successful firms and managers understand what IT can do and how it works, take an active role in shaping its use and measure its impact on revenues and profits.</p>

<p>To align IT with the business and use information systems effectively for competitive advantage, organisations need to perform a strategic systems analysis. To identify the types of systems that provide a strategic advantage to their firms, they should ask the following questions: <br><br></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is the structure of the industry in which the firm is located?</strong>
<ol>
<li>What are some of the competitive forces at work in the industry?</li>
<li>Are there new entrants to the industry?</li>
<li>What is the relative power of suppliers, customers and substitutes products and services over prices?</li>
<li>Is the basis of competition quality, price, or brand?</li>
<li>What is the direction and nature of change within the industry? From where are the momentum and change coming?</li>
<li>How is the industry currently using information technology? Is the organisation behind or ahead of the industry in its application of information systems? <br><br></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>What are the business and industry value chains for this particular firm?</strong>
<ol>
<li>How is the company creating value for the customer; through lower prices and transaction costs or higher quality? Are there any places in the value chain where the business could create more value for the customer and additional profit for the company?</li>
<li>Does the firm understand and manage its business processes using the best practices available? Is it taking maximum advantage of supply chain management, customer relationship management and enterprise systems?</li>
<li>Does the firm leverage its core competencies?</li>
<li>Is the industry supply chain and customer base changing in ways that benefit or harm the firm?</li>
<li>Can the firm benefit from strategic partnerships, ecosystems, or platforms?</li>
<li>Where in the value chain will information systems provide the greatest value to the firm? <br><br></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is IT aligned with the business strategy and goals of the business?</strong>
<ol>
<li>Are business strategy and goals correctly articulated?</li>
<li>Is IT improving the right business processes and activities to promote this strategy?</li>
<li>Are there the right metrics to measure progress towards those goals?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
