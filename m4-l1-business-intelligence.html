<p>Business intelligence is the process by which information is collected from across an organisation. This information is taken from across the organisation and made accessible to decision makers. Historically, different types of information system would target different levels of management within an organisation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img id="298678" src="https://nulondon.instructure.com/courses/2778/files/802612/download?verifier=jMLga1fDrmWsX0Jnp4Xa66YmRCocU0L2w9vBsbWd" alt="3.2_How Functional Systems Interact and Support Decision-Making.jpg" width="798" height="449" data-api-endpoint="https://nulondon.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2778/files/802612" data-api-returntype="File"></p>
<p>Now you understand what business processes are, it is time to look more closely at how information systems support the business processes of a company. Because there are different interests, specialties and levels in an organisation, there are different kinds of systems.<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Traditionally, no single system could provide all the information an organisation needed.</strong></p>
<p>A typical organisation has systems supporting processes for each of the major business functions; sales and marketing, manufacturing and production, finance and accounting and human resources.</p>
<p>Functional systems that operate independently of each other are becoming a thing of the past because they cannot easily share information to support cross-functional business processes. Many have been replaced with large-scale, cross-functional systems that integrate the activities of related business processes and organisational units.</p>
<p>A typical organisation also has different systems supporting the decision-making needs of each of the main management groups. Operational management, middle management and senior management each use systems to support the decisions they must make to run the company. Let's look at these systems and the types of decisions they support.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="kl_border_radius_20 mps-page-subtitle"><img id="71043" src="https://nulondon.instructure.com/courses/2778/files/802585/download?verifier=VvAR84jObyYZCDGpUqMSvRkb40GpVBJiHNFIEety" alt="icon_repeat.png" data-api-endpoint="https://nulondon.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2778/files/802585" data-api-returntype="File"><span>&nbsp;</span>Operational - Transaction Processing Systems</p>
<p>Operational managers need systems that track the elementary activities and transactions of the organisation, such as sales, receipts, cash deposits, payroll, credit decisions and the flow of materials in a factory.</p>
<p class="mps-highlight">Transaction processing systems (TPS) provide this kind of information. A TPS is a computerised system that performs and records the daily routine transactions necessary to conduct business, such as sales order entry, hotel reservations, payroll, employee record keeping and shipping.</p>
<p>At this level, the principal purpose of systems is to answer routine questions and track the flow of transactions through the organisation.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>"How many parts are in inventory?"</em></li>
<li><em>"What happened to Mrs Smith's payment?"</em></li>
</ul>
<p>To answer these kind of questions, information must be easily available, current and accurate. At the operational level, tasks, resources and goals are predefined and highly structured. The decision to grant credit to a customer, for instance, is made by a lower-level supervisor according to predefined criteria. All that must be determined is whether the customer meets the criteria.</p>
<p>Transaction processing systems are often so central to a business that failure for a few hours can lead to a firm's demise and perhaps that of other firms linked to it. Imagine what would happen to Amazon if its warehouse tracking system was not working! What would the airlines do without their computerised reservation systems?</p>

<p class="">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="mps-highlight">Business intelligence<span>&nbsp;</span><span>is a set of techniques, tools and technologies that transform transactional data into useful information which people in the business can understand; it helps managers and other enterprise users make informed decisions. Business intelligence systems for middle management help with monitoring, controlling, decision-making and administrative activities.</span></p>
<p>Business intelligence addresses the decision-making needs of all levels of management. Below are three types of business intelligence systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Management Information Systems (MIS)</li>
<li>Decision-Support Systems (DSS)</li>
<li>Executive Support Systems (ESS)</li>
