<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">In this section, we will look at scheduling conflict resolutions and risk assessments.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;"><em><strong>Complete the conflict detection activity.&nbsp;</strong></em>In this activity, you are going to see how the process of scheduling a change also involves checking for any potential conflicts or periods in which maintenance should not be conducted. As such, there is a system for avoiding conflicts even for standard changes, which skip authorisation and go straight to the scheduling step. For this to work effectively, however, the configuration management database needs to be accurate.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;"><em><strong>Complete the conflict resolution activity.</strong>&nbsp;</em>In this task, we see that there is already maintenance ongoing at a particular time. We can use the scheduling assistant to find a time that will work for us to conduct the change. Having this visibility of other changes is incredibly useful as we will be able to see what other work is being conducted. In this case, it is relatively easy to find a new time, but in a busy organisation with lots of work being done, it may indeed be more challenging. The role of the CAB (change advisory board) beyond reviewing changes is to control the flow and allocation of changes, allowing for all vital work to be conducted.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;"><em><strong>Complete the submit a change request risk assessment activity.&nbsp;</strong></em>As well as proposing a time, we will need to ensure that we have thought about and adequately described any risks associated with the proposed change. This is done through a short survey, with the results being calculated through a related link,&nbsp;'Calculate Risk'. This information is then passed on when the change is assessed and authorised. Part of the assessment process will involve checking the risk assessment process has been properly followed by the proposer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;"><em><strong>Complete the propose a change to a CI activity.</strong>&nbsp;</em>In addition to associating the change request with specific configuration items, we can use the change request process to document how those change requests will actually change. In this case we are affecting the memory allocation of a server. Should the change request be approved, it is now more clear that we will also update the configuration item. We then can request approval, putting the change request in the Assess stage.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;"><em><strong>Complete the approve a change request activity.</strong></em> Note that the above actions happen while the change is being planned, not in the 'Assess' stage. At the same time, our main focus in the assess stage is to make sure the above processes have been followed. Typically in the 'Assess' stage, only one person has to approve the change. The assess stage is only required for Normal changes, and primarily exists to protect the rigour of the change process, as well as the time of the change advisory board. With standard changes, which are routine, the risks are well understood and should be automatically populated. With emergency changes, it is understood that these are for genuine emergencies, and that there will be consequences for anyone abusing the process.</p>

<p><em><strong>Complete the approve a change request (CAB) activity.&nbsp;</strong></em>Historically, CAB meetings were an actual meeting held in a physical space, but with the rise of distributed collaboration and remote working there is increased demand for meetings to be held online or asynchronously. While it is beyond the scope of this exercise, the CAB workbench built into ServiceNow can be used to facilitate live online or in-person meetings, showing clearly the proposed changes in a presentation format. In other situations, members will see the approval request, and be able to comment on the change request through the notes feature. Often, a change management system will require a certain amount of approvals from the CAB; a majority or&nbsp; sometimes even consensus. In this case, for demonstration purposes, a single request is enough to move the process along.</p>
