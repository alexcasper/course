<p>Traditionally, a piece of software would serve a certain function. An organisation might rely on a number of pieces of software, and an IT practitioner would be required to understand the value of each. Think of a worker with a toolbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information systems have grown more sophisticated, given the growth in the importance of data for organisations and the significant increase in the amount of computing power and storage space available. Whereas practitioners might have once relied on specific tools for individual tasks, these tools have evolved to meet more of their customers' requirements. While they provide more functionality, they have become more complex to maintain. Think of a swiss-army knife or multitool. Technology specialists will work to configure these platforms for their specific requirements - this process of adoption is called an <strong><em>implementation.</em></strong> They may work with developers and partners to build custom functionality or features.</p>
<p>Increasingly, companies are working with huge amounts of data, making it impossible or impractical for all relevant data to be stored within a user's file system. Instead, we see the widespread use of <em><strong>dedicated database systems</strong></em>, which are computer servers dedicated to the task of reliably storing an organisation's data. If employees download data to work with or analyse on their machine, it is likely to be an <strong>extract</strong> - a subset of a much larger dataset. Tools for data management will often be used to clean data, ensuring that data taken from various sources conforms to a common standard or&nbsp;<em><strong>data model</strong></em>, allowing us to compare these different datasets. These tools will also provide visualisations and reports. Originally, a visualisation might have been targeted at a particular type of user - an executive, for example. Now, however, information systems are often capable of producing a wide variety of up-to-date, customisable reports - called <strong style="font-style: italic;">dashboards.</strong></p>
<p>An organisation will typically require a number of different databases and datasets. These databases, together with the tools used to clean, analyse and visualise the data are referred to collectively as an organisation's <strong><em>data architecture</em></strong>. Many companies have chosen to standardise their data architecture around a certain toolset provided by a single organisation - a <em><strong>platform</strong></em>. Others have chosen to produce their own solution, either from scratch or using a combination of tools or pieces of software - this is known as a<strong><em> bespoke solution</em></strong>. Creating such a solution will often require substantial investment, but may be worthwhile if the organisation has unique requirements for handling data.</p>

<p>The following article, by Michael Cusumano, argues that 'companies in the information technology business are most successful when their products become industrywide platforms.' At the same time, a difference exists between product and industry platforms. While an industry platform is created by a number of different organisations, a product platform is generally created by a single team or organisation. Note that an industry platform is not the same as a standard - a standard is a set of rules used to ensure different technologies can work together, whereas an industry platform is something created through the work of many organisations and individuals.&nbsp;</p>
