<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The information assets and infrastructure of organisations are constantly threatened. The dynamic threat environment has increased the need for information assurance. Information assurance is not just a technology issue but also a business and social issue.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>IA's goal is to protect the information and infrastructure that supports the mission and vision of an organisation. </strong>This is done through compliance to regulations, risk management and organisational policies.</p>
<p>How does information assurance tackle these problems? Information assurance consists of protecting information and services against disclosure, transfer, modification or destruction (either intentional or unintentional) and ensuring the availability of information in a timely manner. Information assurance also considers the authentication used in a system and how strongly actions can be repudiated. Basically, it ensures only the approved entities receive the accurate information they require when they need it.</p>

<p>Understanding the distinction between the following terms is crucial for identifying fundamental concepts in protecting an organisation's information assets:</p>
<ol>
<li>Information assurance</li>
<li>Information security</li>
<li>Information protection</li>
<li>Cybersecurity</li>
</ol>
<p>The following illustration gives you a good overview of how the four concepts relate to each other. Information assurance is an overarching concept that encompasses the three concepts of information security, information protection and cybersecurity.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Information assurance is the overarching approach for identifying, understanding and managing risk through an organisation's use of information and information systems.</strong></p>
<p>Information assurance is concerned with the lifecycle of information in an organisation through the objectives of maintaining the following services or attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confidentiality</li>
<li>Integrity</li>
<li>Availability</li>
<li>Nonrepudiation</li>
<li>Authentication</li>
</ul>

<p>Information security is a subdomain of information assurance and focuses on the so-called <strong>CIA triad</strong>: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.</p>
<p><strong><u>Confidentialit</u>y</strong></p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong> and privacy are related terms but are not synonymous. Confidentiality is the assurance of data secrecy where no one is able to read data except for the intended person (entity). Confidentiality should prevail no matter what the data state is—whether data resides on a system, is being transmitted, or is in a particular location.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy</strong>, on the other hand, involves personal autonomy and control of information about oneself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Integrit</u>y </strong></p>
<p>In information systems, <strong>integrity</strong> is a service that assures that the information in a system has not been altered except by authorised individuals and processes. It provides assurance of the accuracy of the data and that it has not been corrupted or modified improperly. Integrity may be achieved by applying a mathematical technique whereby the information will later be verified.</p>
<p>A second form of integrity control manages the processes to enter and manipulate information. For example, a doctor (and the patient) would want the integrity of medical records. The records should reflect the actual data from the laboratory and once the data is stored, it should be stored so it is unchangeable outside defined processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Availabilit</u>y</strong></p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong> is the service that assures data and resources are accessible to authorised subjects or personnel when required. The second component of the availability service is that resources such as systems and networks should provide sufficient capacity to perform in a predictable and acceptable manner. Secure and quick recovery from disruptions is crucial to avoid delays or decreased productivity. Therefore, it is necessary that protection mechanisms should be in place to ensure availability and to protect against internal and external threats.</p>
<p>Availability is also often viewed as a property of an information system or service. Most service level agreements and measures of performance for service providers surround availability above all else. The availability of a system may be one of its most crucial properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Nonrepudiation and Authentication</u></strong></p>
<p>The addition of nonrepudiation and authentication complete the concept of information assurance.</p>
<p><strong>Nonrepudiation</strong></p>
<p>Digital transactions are prone to frauds in which participants in the transaction could repudiate (deny) a transaction. A digital signature is evidence that the information originated with the asserted sender of the information and prevents subsequent denial of sending the message.</p>
<p>The term nonrepudiation describes the service that ensures that the involved parties are honest in their actions. There are variants of nonrepudiation, but the most often used are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nonrepudiation of source:</strong> <br>The person cannot deny the creation or sending of a message, or the service will prove otherwise e.g if a digital signature was used.</li>
<li><strong>Nonrepudiation of acceptance:</strong> <br>The recipient cannot deny the reception of a message, or the service will prove otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong></p>
<p>Authentication makes sure the entity presenting the identification can further prove to be whom they claim. To be authenticated, the person must produce minimally a second credential, e.g. password, physical identification or biometrical information.</p>

<p>Information protection is best viewed as a subset of information security. It is often defined in terms of protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information through a variety of means such as policy, standards, physical controls, technical controls, monitoring and information classification or categorisation.</p>
<p>Like information security, information protection includes all information an organisation may process, store, transmit, or disseminate regardless of media. Thus, information on paper, on a hard drive, in the mind of an employee or in the cloud is considered in scope.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cybersecurity is a term that has largely replaced the term computer security. This term is often confused with information assurance and information security.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity is used to describe the measures taken to protect electronic information systems against unauthorised access or attack. Cybersecurity is primarily concerned with the same objectives of information security within the scope of electronic information systems' CIA. <br><br></p>
<p>The following are critical elements to remember about cybersecurity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cybersecurity is primarily focused on the protection of networks and electronic information systems. Other media such as paper, personnel and in some cases stand-alone systems that rely on physical security are often outside the scope of cybersecurity.</li>
<li>Cybersecurity often focuses on the vulnerabilities and threats of an information system at the tactical level. System scanning, patching and secure configuration enforcement are common foci of cybersecurity.</li>
<li>Intrusion detection and incident response and other functions commonly run from a security operations centre (SOC) are often identified as cybersecurity functions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Information Security Management System (ISMS)</strong></p>
<p>An Information Security Management System (ISMS) is a management system that is based on a business risk approach to establish, implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain and improve information security. The management system includes organisational structure, policies, planning activities, responsibilities, practices, procedures, processes and resources.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>ISO 27001 </strong></p>
<p>ISO 27001, the international Information Security Management Standard, was published in 2005 and updated in 2013. It is one of the most popular information security standards of the world. It is now part of a much larger family, of which ISO/IEC 27000 is the root for a whole numbered series of international standards for the management of information security.</p>
